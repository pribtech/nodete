It strives to be a teaching tool for all users of DB2. Whether you're just starting to use DB2, 
or have been for years, there are tutorials for you around many aspects of DB2. Part of what makes 
the TE such a great teaching tool is that it doesn't just explain to you how a system should act, 
the Technology Explorer shows you, using your database! The TE has a large number of views that 
show you how your database is actually behaving. All of the views the TE uses to teach you about 
DB2 can be used individually, making the TE a very powerful monitoring tool as well.
