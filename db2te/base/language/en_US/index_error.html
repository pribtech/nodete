	Welcome to the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 base start page
</h1>
<p>
	This page should shortly be replaced shortly when the web application has completely loaded. 
</p>
<p>
	If this page remains then you likely are having one of these three problems:
</p>

	<h2>
		PHP problems:
	</h2>

<p>
	The TE requires PHP 5.2 but can run in PHP 5.1 given the following modules are available:
	<ul>
		<li>IBM_DB2 – Will not stop the TE from loading but will prevent you from connecting</li>
		<li>JSON</li>
		<li>DOM XML (Use of native or simple XML is supported but requires a configuration change)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Note: On some Linux distribution the native PHP instillation disables JSON for the web server but not the CLI.
</p>

	<h2>
		JavaScript problems:
	</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your browser does not have JavaScript  support</li>
		<li>IE has disabled JavaScript support</li>
		<li>You have turned off JavaScript with in your browser. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	As The Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 is a dynamic web application it requires JavaScript to function. We have tested the TE in the following browsers:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>IE 6 *</li>
	<li>IE 7 *</li> 
	<li>IE 8 *</li>
	<li>Opera 9+</li>
	<li>Safari 3+</li>
	<li>Firefox 3+</li>
	<li>Chrome 2+</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	* Not recommended due to JavaScript performance
</p>


	<h2>
		Aggressive browser caching
	</h2>
<p>
	Most modern browser cache aggressively in most cases this is a good thing but can cause a fixed error to appear to persist. Clear your cache and try loading the page again.

	If you are still having trouble post on the forums with you system and setup information and someone will try to help you.
