The Technology Explorer (TE) is a light weight, web based console for DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows. The Technology Explorer strives to be a teaching tool for all users of DB2. Whether you're just starting to use DB2, or have been for years, there are tutorials for you around many aspects of DB2. Part of what makes the TE such a great teaching tool is that it doesn't just explain to you how a system should act, the Technology Explorer shows you, using your database! The TE has a large number of views that show you how your database is actually behaving. All of the views the TE uses to teach you about DB2 can be used individually, making the TE a very powerful monitoring tool as well.
The Technology Explorer is meant to be a tool for you! You can use it, change it, build it. Everything is defined using XML so you don't need to be a programmer to make changes.


Instruction for extending the TE can be found on our wiki <a href="http://db2mc.sf.net" target="_blank">db2mc.sf.net</a>.
The TE team can be contacted for help though our Source Forge site <a href="http://sf.net/projects/db2mc" target="_blank"> sf.net/projects/db2mc</a>. While this project was started and is continued to be maintained and extended in an IBM lab, this is a community project. We want people who use DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows to customize and extend this project and contribute back to the community. To provide feedback, suggestions, or report defects go to the db2mc project on SourceForge.net located at <a href="http://sf.net/projects/db2mc" target="_blank">sf.net/projects/db2mc</a></td>

<p>A new feature, the Workload Multiuser Driver (WMD) can be used to drive dynamic workloads against your database and can either be used within tutorials and demos or as a seperate tool within the TE.  A Java JRE 1.6+ is required as well as an IBM DB2 jcc driver which can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=4020&uid=swg27016878" target=_blank">IBM jcc download</a> site.  For instructions on how to install, configure, and use the WMD, please visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/db2mc/index.php?title=Workload_Multiuser_Driver" target="_blank"> WMD wiki.</a>
