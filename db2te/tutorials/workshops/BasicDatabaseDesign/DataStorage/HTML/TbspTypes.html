<p>This page describes the different types of tablespaces</p>

<H2><B>Problem Description</B></H2><HR>
<p>With the knowledge of different storage object types, its important to determine the type of space to allocate to store the data.</p>

<H2><B>Operation</B></H2><HR>
<p>Different <b>tablespaces</b> for specific storage requirements are present in DB2. An appropriate tablespace design is chosen for best database performance.</p>

<H2><B>Solution</B></H2><HR>
<p>Table spaces are the logical layer between the database and the tables stored in that database. Table spaces are created within a database and tables are created within table spaces. DB2 supports three kinds of table spaces :
<ol>
<li><b><u>System Managed Space (SMS):</u></b> Here, the operating system's file system manager allocates and manages the space. SMS table spaces require very little maintenance. However, SMS table spaces offer
fewer optimization options and may not perform as well as DMS table spaces</li>
<li><b><u>Database Managed Space (DMS):</u></b> Here, the database manager controls the storage space. This table space is, essentially, an implementation of a special purpose file system designed to best meet the needs of the
database manager</li>
<li><b><u>Automatic Storage With DMS:</u></b>Automated storage is not really a separate type of table space, but a different way of handling DMS storage. DMS containers require more maintenance and Automatic Storage was introduced as a way of simplifying space management</li>
