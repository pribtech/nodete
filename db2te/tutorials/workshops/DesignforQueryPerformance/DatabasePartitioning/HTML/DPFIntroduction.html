<BR><H2><B>Problem Statement</B></H2><HR>
<p>A typical data mart houses huge amount of data which grows exponentially over time. The key challenges when dealing with such data include :</p>
<ol>
<li>Manageability of data</li>
<li>Scaleability of data</li>
<li>Query Performance/retrieval of data</li>
</ol>

<h4>What is Database Partitioning ?</h4>
<p>Database partitioning is a feature that supports distribution of data across database partitions by using a key-hashing algorithm.</p>

<H2><B>Operation</B></H2><HR>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates the data partitioning technique and highlights the best practices to do the same. The
need for creating data partitions and their advantages are analysed. A graph of the query execution time against the 
tables with data partitioning enabled is generated and the steps to create an explain snapshot displaying partition 
elimination during query processing are indicated.</p>

<H2><B>Benefits of Database Partitioning</B></H2><HR>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Significantly reduced times for data management operations such as data loads, backup and recovery, index creation and building</li>
<li>Increased scaleability as the data is spread across multiple database partitions</li>
<li>Highly improved query performance as the query executes in parallel on each partition</li>
<li>Significantly reduced impact of downtime for maintainence operations</li>
</ol>
