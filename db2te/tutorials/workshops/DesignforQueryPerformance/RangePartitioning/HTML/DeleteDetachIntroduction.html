<BR><H2><B>Problem Statement</B></H2><HR>
<p>In a Data Warehouse environment, very old data needs to be eliminated periodically for storage purposes. The key challenges in such a scenario include :</p>
<ol>
<li>Huge volumes of scattered data</li>
<li>Time consuming operation affecting other operations in the system</li>
</ol>

<BR><H2><B>Solution : <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.partition.doc/doc/t0021576.html');">Detach Partition</B></H2><HR></a>

<h4>What is Detach ?</h4>
<p>Detach, in case of Range Partitioned tables enables a specific range of data to be quickly and easily detached.</p>

<H2><B>Operation</B></H2><HR>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates benefits of <b>detach over delete</b> operation thus highlighting the advantages of range partitioning 
in providing an easy way to detach a data partition. A graph comparing the time taken for delete vs detach is generated.</p>

<H2><B>Benefits of Detach vs Delete</B></H2><HR>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced time taken for detach as compared to delete owing to data clustered in a specific range</li>
<li>Lesser I/O overhead in case of delete</li>
</ol>
</p>
