<h4>Get Execution Times of Delete And Detach</h4>
<p>The time taken for DELETE operation and DETACH of a range in a range partitioned table is computed.</p>

<h4>Graph of Delete vs Detach</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>A graph comparing the execution times for DELETE vs DETACH operations is generated.</li>
<li>If you hover your cursor over the bars in the graph you will see the exact execution time for each run.</li>

<p>The time taken for DETACH operation is much lesser compared to the DELETE operation. Hence this demonstrates the advantage of 
range partitioning in that data can be very easily detached from the tables</p>
