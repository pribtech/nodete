to store different ranges of data.</p>

<h4><B><u><FONT style="COLOR: red">Note :</FONT></u>  If the tablespaces are already created, the SQLs may fail. Ignore the failed statements in this case.</B></h4><BR>
<ol>
<li>Create separate tablespaces to store different ranges of data and indexes. This has the following advantages :</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the possibility of data corruption in multiple partitions</li>
<li>Back up and recover each partition independently</li>
<li>Improve manageability, availability and performance</li>
</ul>
<li>Create table 'subscriber_rated_usage_range' enabled with range partitioning</li>
<li>Populate data into the table. Data is stored in separate ranges based on the partitioning key specified</li>
</ol>
