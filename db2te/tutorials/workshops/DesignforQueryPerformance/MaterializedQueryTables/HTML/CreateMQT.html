<p>This page demonstrates creation of replicated MQT on the <b>dimension table</b>.</p>

<H2><B>Operation</B></H2><HR>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Replicated MQT on the dimension table to reside on the partitions containing the fact tables</li>
<li>Refresh the MQT to organize the data within the MQT</li>
<li>Validate the data by issuing the SET INTEGRITY statement. The data is accessible only after integrity check is performed</li>
<li>Execute RUNSTATS to ensure that current statistics are present in the MQT</li>
</ol>
</p>

<BR><H2><B>Best Practices</B></H2><HR>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on frequently-used queries that use a lot of resources. These queries provide the greatest opportunities for performance gains through MQTs.</li>
<li>Set a limit on the number of MQTs that you are willing to maintain. There are
two reasons for this :
  <ul>
	  <li>Each MQT uses storage space on disk and additional UPDATE overhead</li>
	  <li>Each MQT adds complexity to the search for the optimal QEP, increasing query compilation time</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Decide on a limit for the amount of disk space available for MQTs. Generally, do not allocate more than 10% to 20% of the total system storage of a data
warehouse for MQTs</li>
<li>Keep statistics on the MQTs up-to-date</li>
<li>Avoid problematic MQT designs that make routing difficult. Try to avoid using EXISTS, NOT EXISTS, and SELECT DISTINCT. Unless the MQT is an exact match for a query, these predicates can make it difficult for the query compiler to make use of the MQT.</li>
</ol>
