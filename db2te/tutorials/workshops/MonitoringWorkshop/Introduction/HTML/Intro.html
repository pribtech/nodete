<H2>Pre-requisites<HR></H2>
<BR>
The workshop contains four tutorials. Refer to the list below and their pre-requisites.
<ul>
<li> Using DB2 monitoring text reports     :: Requires DB2 9.7 Fixpack 1 or higher</li>
<li> Leveraging TE reports                 :: Requires DB2 9.7 GA or higher</li>
<li> Problem determination with TE reports :: Requires DB2 9.7 GA or higher</li>

</ul>

<H2>Database monitoring<HR></H2>
<BR>
Database monitoring is a vital activity to ensure performance and
and health of your database management system. To facilitate monitoring, DB2 collects
information from the database manager, its databases, and any connected applications. <BR><BR>
You can then take the appropriate actions based on this information. Examples are: <BR>
<ul>
 <li>Forecast hardware requirements based on database usage patterns</li>
 <li>Analyze the performance of individual applications or SQL queries</li>
 <li>Track the usage of indexes and tables</li>
 <li>Pinpoint the cause of poor system performance</li>
 <li>Assess the impact of optimization activities (for instance, altering database manager configuration parameters, adding indexes, or modifying SQL queries)</li>
</ul>
<BR><P align=justify>
Starting with DB2 Version 9.7, you can access monitor data through a light-weight
alternative to the traditional system monitor. Use monitor table functions to collect
and view data for systems, activities, or data objects.  <BR><BR>
Data for monitored elements are continually accumulated in memory and available for querying.
You can choose to receive data for a single object (for example, service class A or
table TABLE1) or for all objects.
<BR><BR>
<B>The tutorial demonstrates how few of these monitoring functions can be used
to determine the reason for the problem, in this case performance slowdown.</B>
