<H2>Troubleshooting SQL performance slowdowns<HR></H2>
The workshop covers troubleshooting SQL performance slowdown incidents in
production environments. 
<BR>
<P align="justify">
<H4>An SQL performance slowdown incident satisfies the following two conditions:</H4><BR>
<ul>
<li>The incident starts with a problem report of certain SQL statements performing
too slowly that normally perform adequately.</li>
<li>The cause or explanation of this problem is not immediately apparent.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<P align="justify">
<H4>A problem report can come from various sources, such as the following examples:</H4><BR>
<ul>
<li>Business users report, through help desk trouble tickets, that the system seems
slow today.</li>
<li>A developer reports a problem with a set of queries she wrote to generate a
management report. Her report performed fine on the test system, but when it
was promoted to the production system it ran too slowly.</li>
<li>A data center operator reports that a batch job is taking much longer than is
typical.</li>
<li>A database administrator receives an alert from a mechanism they have setup to
notify them of response times that exceed an agreed-upon service level.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<P align="justify">
<H4>Response time is perceived as ?too slow? when it is slower relative to expectations
set by comparisons such as the following comparisons:</H4><BR>
<ul>
<li>The system is slower than the same system at a previous time. For example, the
response time a day earlier before a configuration change.</li>
<li>The system is slower than a similar system. For example a test server or another
production server.</li>
<li>An SQL statement runs longer than similar SQL statements. For example the
same statement except for a minor change to the WHERE clause.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<P align="justify">
The cause or explanation of a problem is not immediately apparent. The problem
could be caused by different things influenced by different people. For example,
the problem could be caused by things in the realm of the database management
system (DBMS) server under the purview of the database administrator; the
problem could be caused by the application SQL and code under the purview of
the application developer; the problem could be caused by other IT technical areas
such as storage under the purview of IT staff, other than the database
administrator. 
<BR><BR>
<H4>In this workshop, a step by step approach is being used to troubleshoot any of the problems.</H4>
<B>The steps followed in diagnosing the problem are as below :: </B><BR><BR>
<ul>
<li>Determining the problem category.</li>
<li>Performing a detailed diagnosis.</li>
<li>Identifying the scope of SQL statements.</li>
<li>Conclusion.</li>
</ul>
