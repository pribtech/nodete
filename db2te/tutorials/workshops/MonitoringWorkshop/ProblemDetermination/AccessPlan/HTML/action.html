<H2>Solution to the problem<HR></H2>
<BR>
<font color=grey><B>The database administrator earlier concluded the problem for SQL performance slowdown to be a 'table scan' 
as the index was not present on the predicate column.
As a solution to the problem, database administrator creates an index on the column, which is the search predicate 
for the query or workload run.</B></font> <BR><BR>
The DDL for the creating the index is present on the right pane. The workload or the query is run again. 
Now, with the index in place DB2 picks the index to satisfy the query. With this, the ratio of number of rows read 
vs the number of rows returned reduces considerably, improving the performance of the query.
