<a class="sourceAdd">Recall that the database administrator has localized the slowdown is in SQL statement processing.  
A common approach is to explain the SQL statement and analyze the access plan. The database administrator 
looks at the monitoring report generated to get a quick, initial indication of why the statements are so expensive.</a><BR>
<H2>Few monitor elements useful for analyzing expensive access plan operations<HR></H2>

<ul>
<li><B>ROWS_READ/ROWS_RETURNED <I>(Worse than normal)</I></B> :: This often indicates that indexes are not being used extensively.</li><BR>
<li><B>Total sorts and other sort metrics <I>(Normal)</I></B> :: Excessive sorting is NOT the problem.</li><BR>
</ul>

<a class="sourceChange">The evidence suggests that the slow statements are scanning table rows rather than using an index, because no suitable index is available. </a>
