<H2>Determining the problem category<HR></H2>
<BR>
<P align=justify>
<a class="sourceAdd">As part of the initial diagnosis, the database administrator looks for familiar
patterns of symptoms to categorize the problem at a high level. The database administrator 
views the report to identify abnormal values. The database administrator focuses on key 
indicators that can rule-in or rule-out common, general problems.</a>
<BR>
<H2>Few metrics that indicate some general problem categories<HR></H2>

<BR>
<ul>
<li><B>TOTAL_CPU_TIME <I>(Higher than normal)</I></B> :: High processor usage is a good indicator that the slowdown is located within data server processing. The data server is working harder than normal to handle application requests.<BR></li><BR>
<li><B>CLIENT_IDLE_WAIT_TIME <I>(Normal)</I></B> :: The slowdown is NOT located in the client.<BR></li><BR>
<li><B>TOTAL_WAIT_TIME <I>(Normal)</I></B> :: Requests are NOT spending more time waiting for resources needed such as locks or for input and output.<BR></li><BR>
<li><B>TOTAL_SECTION_PROC_TIME <I>(Higher than normal)</I></B> :: The cost of SQL statements (access plan sections) has increased.<BR></li><BR>
</ul>
<BR>
<a class="sourceChange">From this evidence, the database administrator concludes that slowdown is localized in statement processing. </a>
