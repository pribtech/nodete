<h2>Operation</h2><hr><BR>

As the database adminitrator has resolved the problem with the SQL statement, he now begins to validate the system by performing the following steps:<BR><BR>
<ul type=i>
<li>Executes the SQL statement in the adhoc sql window on the top-right pane.</li>
<li>Goes through the detailed diagnosis again, to verify if the query is behaving as expected.</li>
</ul>
<BR>

<H2>Highlights</H2><HR><BR>

<div class="titleboxcontent">View "<B>Detail diagnostic information</B>"</div><b> - Bottom-right pane.</B><BR>
    The view displays the statistics like rows read, rows returned etc, for all the queries executed under each service class.
	<ul>
	    <li>Note the <B>rows read</B> and the <B>rows returned</B> for the query.</li>
		<li>The ratio of rows read to rows returned has reduced to a great extent with the creation of appropriate indexes by the database adminitsrator.</li> 
	</ul>	
<BR>
	For more details on the diagnosis, click on the below highlighted panel.	<BR><BR>	
		<span style="height:30px; cursor: pointer;" onclick="MinimizeWindow('showme_DD');"><div class="linkboxcontent"><H4>Performing Detailed Diagnosis</H4></div></span>

<font color=grey><B>The database administrator looks at the monitoring report generated here, to check, if the statements 
which were expensive are performing as expected now.</B></font><BR><BR>

To start with the validating the system, the database administrator executes the query and monitors the TE 
view on the bottam-right pane and finds that the metrics 
<BR><BR>
<ul>
<li><B>ROWS_READ/ROWS_RETURNED :</B> Is normal / as expected now.</li>
<li><B>Total sorts and other sort metrics :</B> Is normal.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<font color=grey><B>The evidence suggests that the statements which were slow earlier, due to 
scanning table rows rather than using an index, perform as expected with "index scans" taking place.</b></font>
