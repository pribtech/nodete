<ul>
<li>TOTAL_COMPILATIONS <I>(Value keeps increasing unexpectedly, make a note of this value)</I></li>
<li>PKG_CACHE_INSERTS <I>(Value keeps increasing unexpectedly, make a note of this value)</I></li>
<li>PKG_CACHE_LOOKUPS <I>(Value is unexpectedly low, make a note of this value)</I></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, we would like to see very minimal compilations and package cache inserts. At the same time, package cache lookups should be high to indicate package is being reused. The above evidence suggests that a larger portion of SQL statements are being compiled rather than retrieving their access plans from the package cache.</p>
