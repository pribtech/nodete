<h2> Introduction<hr></h2>

<p>The objective of this scenario is to use the DB2 monitoring text report to identify and isolate a <b>lock wait problem</b>.
<p>
<B><font color=grey>In this problem, slow application request(s) are spending more time waiting for locks. This is due to more requests contending for the same few rows in a particular table. 
<br>This scenario illustrates the use of monitoring information to troubleshoot a slowdown in response time reported on a production system. 
<BR>
</font></B>
<BR>
DB2 provides many monitoring tools to diagnose different types of problems. The scenario illustrated here uses a DB2 module called <B>MONREPORT</B> to monitor information and troubleshoot a response time slowdown on a production system. The <B>MONREPORT</B> module provides a set of procedures for retrieving a variety of monitoring data and generating text reports.
<BR>
At the end of this scenario, there is enough information available about the problem to fix it.

<h2>Problem to diagnose<hr></h2>
<p>
The Purchase item application is slowed down due to time spent waiting for locks on the <CODE>INVENTORY</CODE> table to be released.
</p><p>
Troubleshooting this problem involves getting these questions answered:
<ul>
<li>What is the general type of problem?</li>
<li>What part of the user workload is impacted by the slowdown? What does this set of SQL statements have in common?</li>
<li>What is the detailed description of the lock wait problem?</li>
<li>What sequence of events led to this problem occurring at this time?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Tutorial Flow:</h2><hr>
<ul>
<li>Determining the problem category</li>
<li>Performing detailed diagnosis of the problem</li>
<li>Identifying the scope of the SQL statements involved</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre-requisite:</h2><hr>
<ul>
	<li>Create Sample database using the following command:</li>
		<ul>
			<li><CODE><B>db2sampl</B></CODE></li>
		</ul>
	<li>User should have <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE> privileges on <CODE>SYSIBMADM.MONREPORT</CODE> module. For example, use the following command to grant <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE> privilege to user <CODE>'testuser'</CODE>:</li>
	<ul>
			<li><CODE>GRANT EXECUTE ON MODULE SYSIBMADM.MONREPORT TO USER testuser</CODE></li>
		</ul>
