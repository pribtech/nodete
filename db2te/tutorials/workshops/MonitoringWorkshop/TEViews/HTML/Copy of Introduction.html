One of the major Technology Explorer feature is 'Views'. You can define your own views against an SQL statement or any table function. Once you have defined a view, all you have to do is to click on a menu item and view its results.
<p>Instead of remembering the monitoring function, you can easily create a view in Technology Explorer. The views in Technology Explorer are defined in XML profiles. Each view has its own XML profile stored within the web server. The XML file controls the SQL to run, the columns to be displayed, cross reference links, and actions. It even controls detailed information on the page itself, searching rules, how many rows to display, and much more.

Technology Explorer allows you to generate these views from any SQL statement in a very easy manner.
