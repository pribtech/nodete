When it comes to database monitoring, there are many different aspects and areas you have to examine. 
DB2 provides a comprehensive set of monitoring functions, routines, and tools to help you diagnose and 
identify the problem area. 
<BR><BR>
Imagine you have to type in the SQL statements with monitoring functions, capture the results, parse 
the results, analyze the results, and execute the SQL statements again to obtain the rate of changes. 
It doesn't sound like an efficient and effective task.
<BR><BR>
One of Technology Explorer features, Views (or Reports) addresses this problem very easily. TE allows 
you to define and customize your own views against any SQL statement (including the use of monitoring 
table functions). Once you have defined a view and created a menu for it, you can view the results at 
real time whenever you need it. 
<BR><BR>
Views in TE are defined in XML profiles. The XML file controls what 
SQL statement to run, how the columns are displayed, what are the cross reference links and any associated 
actions. It even controls detailed information on the page itself, searching rules, rows to display, and much more. 
<BR><BR>
Before you know it, you will have a set of your own views for your own database system. You can also easily 
put the views together and build a dashboard. A customized dashboard that tells you the health of your system 
at a glance. 
<BR><BR>
TE allows you to generate these views from any SQL statement in a very easy manner. This tutorial 
will take you through various steps needed to create a view in TE.
