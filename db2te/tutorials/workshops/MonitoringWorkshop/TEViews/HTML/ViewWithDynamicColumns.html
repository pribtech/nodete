<h3>View with dynamic columns</h3>
<hr>
You can see the new view in right side pane. You can see the column 'Total CPU Rate'. This column is derived from TOTAL_CPU_TIME but as a dynamic column. This column will show the amount of CPU time an application has taken in a specific time period.
<P>
You can find the complete XML profile of this view <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/Others/ViewWithDynamicColumns.html');">here</a>.
