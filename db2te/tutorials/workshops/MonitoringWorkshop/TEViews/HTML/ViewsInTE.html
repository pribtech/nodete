<h3>Adding more to these views</h3>
<hr>
Now we will explore more options for these views.

<p><B>Key features:</B>
<ul>
	<li>You can also link any column of a view with other views. All you need to do is to specify the local and reference view names and their respective column names. Refer to <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/Others/applicationPerformance.html');">Statistics-->Applications-->Performance</a> view for more details.</li>
	<li>You can also include dynamic columns in your views.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, you can directly save the XML profile by clicking on 'Save' on top right side of the results window.</li>
	<li>Once you have your XML profile, you need to place it in tableFunctions directory (in any sub directory or in any new directory). You can find this directory under TE base directory.</li>
	<li>Once the file is saved at proper location, you need to create a menu item in Technology Explorer.(Explained in next page)</li>
