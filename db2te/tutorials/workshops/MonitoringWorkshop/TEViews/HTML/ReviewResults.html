<h3>Re-Analyse results</h3>
<hr>
Once the sample workload is run, we will again call the monitoring funtion and analyse the results again. Note the changes in the results. These changes are because of the workload that we just executed.
<P>You can notice changes in <CODE>TOTAL_CPU_TIME, TOTAL_ACT_TIME, ACT_COMPLETED_TOTAL, TOTAL_WAIT_TIME and CLIENT_IDLE_WAIT_TIME</CODE> columns.

<P>In general, this is how monitoring is done using table functions. You get the results from table functions, run some workload and then get the results again and analyze the difference. We will see how this task can be drastically simplyfied using views in Technology Explorer in next few pages.
