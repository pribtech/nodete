<li>The security administrator (SECADM) creates two roles: custService and Mgr. <br>
<ul>
<li>Employees of customer service department are granted 'custService' role.</li>
<li>Managers of customer service department are granted 'Mgr' role.</li>
<li>The SECADM grants SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges to these roles</li>
<li>The SECADM grants roles to users.</li>
</ul>
