<p><b>You must log into the database as Joe before proceeding with this page.</b></p>
<br>Joe is the manager of customer service department. Check if he can access <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> table data when connected from non-trusted connection.</p>

<br><br><h4>Operation</h4><br>

Joe gets default role 'Mgr' privileges to perform SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE operations on <font face="courier">'credit_card'
</font> table. 

</P>

<br><br><h4>Solution</h4><br>
The query results in the right pane show that user Joe is not able to execute any of the SQL statements when 
connected through non-trusted connection. Joe gets the privileges only when connection through trusted connection.
