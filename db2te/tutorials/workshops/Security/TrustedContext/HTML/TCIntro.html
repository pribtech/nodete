Data security is becoming one of the biggest challenges for J.K.Avro superstore. Data access needs to be restricted, when connected to database server through
web servers or application servers. <br><br>

J.K.Avro superstore is looking for a solution which gives greater control on access to database when connected through webserver or application server.

<h2>Operation</h2><hr><br>
To be compliant with PCI security requirement <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #CCC">"Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data"</font>,
and to prevent access to sensitive information in <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> table from outside the
organizational premisis, the J.K.Avro superstore decides to implement trusted connection using trusted context objects.<br><br>

<h2>Solution</h2><hr><br>
A trusted connection allows the initiator of this trusted connection to acquire additional capabilities that may not be available outside the scope of the trusted connection.<br><br>


<p>This tutorial demonstrates how DB2's "Trusted Context" feature address the above problem. Topics presented are:
<ul>
<li>Create trusted context object.</li>
<li>Access data through trusted connection.</li>
<li>Switch users within trusted connection.</li>
<li>Audit trusted context object.</li>
</ul>
</p>
