<br>Bob is an employee of J.K.Avro superstore. He is granted 'SECRET' security label
through role 'custService'. Check what columns of <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> table can Bob access.</p>

<h4>Operation</h4><br>
<p>Execute SELECT statement given in the right pane.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4><br>

Bob does not have privileges to perform SELECT operation as he is granted 'SECRET' security label with only WRITE ACCESS.
Hence he will not be able to read any columns from the <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> table.</p>
