confidential information. Once submitted, this data is stored in the <font face="Courier">'credit_card'</font> table and the purchase order placed by the customer is stored
in the <font face="Courier">'PurchaseOrder'</font> table. Every purchase order placed will have a corresponding entry in the <font face="Courier">'sales'</font> table.  </p>
