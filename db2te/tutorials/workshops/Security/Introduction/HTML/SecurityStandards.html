<BR>In today's business world data privacy and data security are becoming a major concern not only for individuals but also for business organizations.
<ul><li><b>Data privacy</b> refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation
of privacy in the collection and sharing of data. </li><br>
<li><b>Data security</b> is the means of ensuring that data is kept safe from corruption and access to it is suitably controlled. </li></ul><br>


<br><H3>Security Standards</H3><hr><br>
By the global nature of the Web, data privacy and data security compliance include both US and non-US security regulations.
DB2 security features enable organizations to be compliant with standards.
<BR><BR>One such standard is <b>Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS)</b>.
This regulation is owned and distributed by the PCI Security Standards Council. It is a collaborative effort between major credit card companies
and is designed to protect customers' personal information.
