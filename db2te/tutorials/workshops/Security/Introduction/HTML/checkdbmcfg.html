<h2>Understanding SYS groups</h2><hr><br>

<p>DB2 defines different hierarchal levels of authorities, SYSADM, SYSCTRL,
SYSMAINT, SYSMON, SECADM, and DBADM. Each with the ability to perform
a subset of administrative operations such as creating of a database, creating
database backups, and retrieving data. The first four authorization levels operate
on the instance level (DB2 database manager level) and have system wide scope authority. Each of these
authorities is associated with a specific DB2 instance level parameter that
controls which users receive that authority.</p>

<p>DB2 database manager level authorities are associated with group membership, and the group
names that are associated with the authority levels are stored in the database manager configuration file for a specific instance.</p>

<p> To see instance level parameter values for SYSADM_GROUP, SYSCTRL_GROUP, SYSMAINT_GROUP, <b>execute "db2 get dbm cfg" from DB2 Command window</b> as shown in the right pane. </p>

<p><b>In Windows operating system</b>,
The following users have SYSADM authority if "NULL" is specified for sysadm_group database manager configuration parameter:<br><br>

    * Members of the local Administrators group<br>
    * Members of the Administrators group at the Domain Controller if DB2_GRP_LOOKUP is not set or set to DOMAIN<br>
    * Members of DB2ADMNS group if Extended Security feature is enabled. The location of the DB2ADMNS group was decided during installation<br>
    * The LocalSystem account<br>
<br>

<b>For Linux and UNIX systems</b>, if "NULL" is specified as the value of this parameter, the SYSADM group defaults to the primary group of the instance owner.

<P>On windows, users are created under local administrators group. User who creates a database gets SYSADM authority.</p>
