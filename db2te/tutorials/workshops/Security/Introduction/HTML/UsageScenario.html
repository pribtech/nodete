<br><h3>Usage Scenario</h3><hr><br>

<p>J.K Avro Superstore has a web-store front through which a customer can browse through the products and place his purchase order.
After the customer checks out the products in his cart, he is given a form to fill in sensitive information like credit card number and other
confidential information. Once submitted, this data is stored in table <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> and the purchase order placed by the customer is placed 
in table <font face="courier">'PurchaseOrder'</font>. Every purchase order placed will have a corresponding entry in table <font face="courier">'Sales'</font>.  </p>

<p>The data in table <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> contains customer confidential information which should be accessed by authorized user in an 
 absolute needed basis. The data in the table <font face="courier">'Sales'</font> is monitored by sales managers of respective regions. 
In this scenario we introduce different users to demonstrate the restricted access to the  table <font face="courier">'credit_card'</font> based on the 
authorities and privileges granted to them. Users to be created are shown in next page.
