<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
	As part of customer relationship building the hospital decides to send information about upcoming health events to its patients.  
	On further analysis the hospital realizes that address information for many patients is inaccurate or incomplete.
</p>
<p>
The patient information along with the address is captured by the healthcare application. 
There has not been any validation to the address XML document as there has been for PMD. 
The address XML also needs to be validated without any alteration to the application in the present situation.
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	Triggers are the best option when an operation needs to be done without modifying the existing application architecture. 
	The patient information and address XML might be inserted through a stored procedure. 
	A trigger can be fired if any of the three DML (Data manipulation language) like insert, update or delete happens. 
	The following trigger fires before the insert of patient details and checks for schema validation and allows only if 
	the address XML is valid according to the schema.
<ul>
<li><b><code>CREATE TRIGGER</code></b> -- creates a trigger which fires if any of the DML statements are issued to the 
particular table to which the trigger is bind. Trigger is fired as specified in its definition as BEFORE or AFTER.</li>
<li><b><code>XMLVALIDATE</code></b> -- To validate the XML document that is inserted. This will be fired by the trigger when a row is inserted in Patient_details table</li>

</ul></br>
<p>The patient detials for the first insert succeeds while the second insert fails since it does not comply with the 
schema that the trigger is validating.
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
	The address XML of the patient is validated for correctness before feeding it into the application.
