<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
	Patients who visit a health care provider need to provide their contact information and medical history information. 
	This detail is created when the patient first approaches the provider. When a returning patient visits the health care provider again, 
	his personal information and past and current medical details are retrieved.
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	Use SQL/XML queries to fetch patient data.
<ul>
<li>SELECT SQL clause to fetch the data.<li>
<li>XMLQUERY queries the particular node in the PMD.<li>
<li>XMLEXISTS checks whether data exists in a particular node.<li>
</ul></br>
The example here shows that XMLQUERY is an SQL scalar function 
that enables you to execute an XQuery expression from within an SQL context.
</p>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
	Patients information and his medical history in XML are retrieved.
</p>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use SQL/XML functions while querying.</li>
<li>Use XMLEXISTS predicate in the SQL WHERE clause.</li>
</ul>
