<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	Any patient visiting a health care provider must register at the clinic. 
	As soon as the patients personal information is provided, he moves on for 
	consultation. Based on the consultation, the health care provider records 
	the diagnostic details and disease description in a PMD document in XML form. 
	<BR><BR>
	If the patient is already registered, the most recent PMD document is 
	updated to include the diagnostic details and disease descriptions.
	<BR><BR>
	Due to the volume of data and nature of the business, the health care 
	provider wants to perform data archival every quarter and keep only 9 
	months of data in the base table.     	
</p>


<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>DB2 <B>native XML storage</B> is demonstrated here. Column PMD is defined as XML type in the table OUT_PATIENT_DATA.</li><BR>
		<li><B>XML support in range partitioned table</B> is demonstrated here. Table OUT_PATIENT_DATA is partitioned based on the date stored in column DATE_OF_CONSULTANCY. 
			Each partition contains quarterly data.</li>
 	</ul>
</p>


<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	Three tables are created to hold details of the disease, patients personal details, and patients medical records. 
	<ul>
		<li> Disease description - Holds all details / code about disease  </li>
	<BR> 	
		<li> Patient details - Holds patients personal information. Addresses of the 
			 patients are stored in a native DB2 XML column. </li>
	<BR>	
		<li> Out patient data - Holds PMD documents which contains all medical information 
			 about the patients. PMD documents are stored in a native DB2 XML column. </li>
	</ul>	 	 
</p>
<P>

<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	<ul>
		<li> <B>Database managed table spaces (DMS) </B> provides higher performance than operating system managed table spaces (SMS). 
	    	     This is true for relational data, and even more so for XML read and write access. </li>
	<BR>
		<li> If some or all of your XML documents are small enough to fit into their corresponding row on the base table page 
		     in the DAT object, they can be <B>inlined</B> into the relational row. This provides more direct access to the XML data 
		     and avoids the redirected access to the XDA object. </li>
	<BR>
		<li> If an XML document is too large to fit on a single page in a table space, DB2 splits the document into multiple 
		     regions which are then stored on multiple pages. As a rule of thumb, <B>choose a page size for XML</B> data which is not 
		     smaller than two times your average expected document size, subject to the maximum of 32 KB.</li>
	<BR>
		<li> With the performance analysis done and you find that you need a large page size for XML data 
		     but a small page size for relational data or indexes, you can use separate table spaces to achieve this. 
		     When you define a table, you can direct <B>"long" data into a separate table space with a different page size.</B> 
		     Long data includes LOB and XML data.  </li>
	</ul>
</p>
