The import utility can be used to import XML data into an XML table column using either the table name or 
a nickname for a DB2 Database for Linux, UNIX, and Windows source data object. When importing data into 
an XML table column, you can use the XML FROM option to specify the paths of the input XML data file or files. 
<BR><BR>					 
For example, for an XML file "/home/user/xmlpath/xmldocs.001.xml" that had previously been exported, 
the following command could be used to import the data back into the table.

   IMPORT FROM t1export.del OF DEL XML FROM /home/user/xmlpath INSERT INTO USER.T1

<H4>Exporting XML data</H4>
<P align = "justify">
When exporting XML data, the resulting QDM (XQuery Data Model) instances are written to a file or files 
separate from the main data file containing exported relational data. This is true even if neither the 
XMLFILE nor the XML TO option is specified. By default, exported QDM instances are all concatenated to 
the same XML file. You can use the XMLINSEPFILES file type modifier to specify that each QDM instance be 
written to a separate file.
<BR><BR>
The XML data, however, is represented in the main data file with an XML data specifier (XDS). The XDS 
is a string represented as an XML tag named "XDS", which has attributes that describe information about 
the actual XML data in the column; such information includes the name of the file that contains the actual 
XML data, and the offset and length of the XML data within that file. 				
<BR><BR>
The destination paths and base names of the exported XML files can be specified with the XML TO and XMLFILE 
options. If the XML TO or XMLFILE option is specified, the format of the exported XML file names, stored in 
the FIL attribute of the XDS, is xmlfilespec.xxx.xml, where xmlfilespec is the value specified for the 
XMLFILE option, and xxx is a sequence number for xml files produced by the export utility. Otherwise, the 
format of the exported XML file names is: exportfilename.xxx.xml, where exportfilename is the name of the 
exported output file specified for the EXPORT command, and xxx is a sequence number for xml files produced 
by the export utility.
<BR><BR>
By default, exported XML files are written to the path of the exported data file. The default base name for 
exported XML files is the name of the exported data file, with an appending 3-digit sequence number, 
and the .xml extension.
