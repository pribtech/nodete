<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
After a patient receives treatments from a health care provider, he/she is billed with the expenses incurred. As directed by the patient, the invoice can be directed to the appointed insurance company for medical expense claims.
Assume that the insurance company has not deployed their XML solution, all data is stored in relational data format. This requires a data massaging 
process to convert XML data (from health care provider) into relational (for the insurance company).
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
Annotated schema decomposition makes this easy. The process shreds an XML document into relational data.
</p>
<p>The following are the steps involved in annotated schema decompostion</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Register the schema based on which the XML will be shredded using REGISTER XMLSCHEMA or the system procedure XSR_REGISTER.</li>
<li>Complete the registration using COMPLETE or XSR_COMPLETE.</li>
<li>Enable the schema for decomposition using ENABLE DECOMPOSITION</li>
<li>Use xdbDecompXML  PROC to decompose an XML document to the specified table in the schema document.</li>
</ul>
</P>
</br></br>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
The patient information after the complete treatment from the health care provider with address is sent to the insuranace company
where it is shredded and dumped to the database of the insurance company in the relational format.
</p>
<p>The result of the XML data shreded can be viewed in the result tab.</p>
</br></br></br></br>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>
Ensure that the XML document is valid according to its XML schema. Validation is not a requirement for decomposition, however,
 if you expect certain behavior, such as character entity expansion, then perform decomposition with validation.
