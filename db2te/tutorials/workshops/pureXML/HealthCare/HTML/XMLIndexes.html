<b>Scenario</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	The health care provider finds that reports to extract information from the PMD documents takes longer than usual.
</p>


<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	XML indexes is demonstrated over here.
<ul>
	<li>An XML index, with the patients given names as the index key, is created on the XML document.</li>
	<li>GENERATE KEY USING XMLPATTERN is used to specify the key within the XML document.</li>
 	<li>A partition level index (i.e. index local to the range of data) is created to further improve
	performance because index search will be faster to be performed on the data in a range.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	The DBA of the health care provider, get to know that the growing volume of data
	(business requirement : 9 months of data to be preserved in the base table) resulted in degradation of performance.
	He creates partition level indexes (Indexes local to the ranges of data) to improve the performance of the queries.<BR><BR>
	<B>Advantages of having a partition level indexes</B>
	<ul>

		<li> Index search wil be faster as the index tree built will be only for the data in a range</li>
		<li> Index rebuild / building process will be faster as size of index tree is less. Time taken for roll-in / roll-out operation would be less.</li>
	</ul>
		</p>
<P>
