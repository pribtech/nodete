<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
	The health care provider receives a new patient, James Mathew, who doesnt have any previous record in the system. 
	A new patient request is processed and James information is then inserted.
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	Insert patients address and complete medical details as XML documents into the patient_details and out_patient_data tables.
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>INSERT SQL command to insert the data.</li>
	<li>Out_Patient_Data table has column PMD of XML datatype to which the PMD document is inserted.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
	These XML documents are now stored natively with other relational data in DB2.
	The new record for the patient James Mathew is entered into the application.
</p>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a prerequisite to use DMS to have large page size such as 16KB or 32KB. The larger the page size fewer the number of potential 
splits per document and improves insert and retrivel.</li>
<li>Give sufficient buffer pool space to support index reads. This is because even though no indexes are defined DB2 pure XML 
storage mechanism transparently maintains regions and path indexes for efficient XML storage access.
</li>
<li>Its better to define XML Indexes before inserting data since the XML. Since while insert each XML docuemnt will be processed only once to create
index entries.</li>
<li>Increasing the LOGBUFSZ and the LOGFILSZ will increase the insert performance. This is important for XML inserts since the data volume is 
bigger for each row.</li>

</ul>
