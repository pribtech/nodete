<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	The health care provider was initially not compliant to any medical industry standard. 
	All PMD documents were inserted into the out_patient_data table in any form the clinic liked. 
	
	The clinic then realizes many advantages to conform to the PMD standard. Hence, they begin to 
	validate all PMD documents based on the standard, when inserting and updating the document.
</p>

<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	XML schema validation is demonstrated here. 
	<ul>
		<li>XML documents are inserted into the tables.</li>
		<li>Use SYSPROC.XSR_REGISTER stored procedure to register an XML schema file.</li>
		<li>Complete the registration with the SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE stored procedure.</li>
		<li>Insert an XML document and validate it against the XML schema file with the XMLVALIDATE function. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<BR>

<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	XML schema for the PMD document is registered in DB2. Any PMD documents inserted 
	and updated in the out_patient_data table are validated against the registered XML schema. 
</p>
<P>


<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	<ul>
		<li>
		For high performance inserts avoid performing schema 
		validation in DB2 if it is not really needed. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
