<H4>Use DMS and larger pages for better for XML performance</H4>

<P align="justify">
Database managed table spaces (DMS) provides higher performance than operating system managed table spaces (SMS). 
This is true for relational data, and even more so for XML read and write access. 
In DB2 9, newly created table spaces are DMS by default. It is also recommended to use DMS table spaces with 
automatic storage so that DMS containers grow as needed without manual intervention. If an XML document is too 
large to fit on a single page in a table space, DB2 splits the document into multiple regions which are then stored on multiple pages. 
This is transparent to your application and allows DB2 to handle XML documents up to the bind-in limit of 2 GB per document.

<P align="justify">
Generally, the lower the number of regions (splits) per document the better the performance, especially for insert and full-document retrieval. 
If a document does not fit on a page, the number of splits per document depends on the page size (4 KB, 8 KB, 16 KB, or 32 KB). 
The larger the page size of your table space the lower the number of potential splits per document. For example, let's say a given 
document gets split across forty 4 KB pages. Then the same document may get stored on only twenty 8 KB pages, or ten 16 KB or five 32 KB pages, respectively. 
If the XML documents are significantly smaller than the selected page size, no space will be wasted since multiple small documents can be stored on a single page.
<BR>
<P align="justify">
As a rule of thumb, choose a page size for XML data which is not smaller than two times your average expected document size, 
subject to the maximum of 32 KB. If you use a single page size for relational and XML data, or for data and indexes, 
a 32 KB page size may be beneficial for XML data but somewhat detrimental for relational data and index access. In such cases, 
16 KB or 8 KB pages may be a better choice that works well for both.
