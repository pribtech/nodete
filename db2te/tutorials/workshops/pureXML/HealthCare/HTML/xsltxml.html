<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
PMD documents are also used by other authorized parties such as other clinic laboratories and medical professionals. 
Although XML is getting popular, it cannot be expected for all parties to understand XML documents. 
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
The Extensible Style Sheet transformation technique helps to convert a XML document into a HTML format so that it can be clearly understood by anyone.
This is achieved by linking an XSL document into the XML document to describe how XML data should be presented in HTML format.
</p>
</br></br>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
A PMD document which is an XML document is associated with a XSL document. It describes how the patient data should be presented.
</p>
</br></br>
<br/>

<p>
The below link displays a XSL Transformation of a XML PMD document.
</p>
<tr><a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/HTML/PMD_XSL.php?BASE_DIR=?BASE_DIRECTORY?');">Patient Medical Document</a></tr>
</br></br></br></br>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Source XML documents must be single-rooted and well-formed.</li>
<li>XSLT transformation produces UTF-8 characters by default. 
Output stream might lose characters if inserted into columns defined with character data types.</li>
</ul>
