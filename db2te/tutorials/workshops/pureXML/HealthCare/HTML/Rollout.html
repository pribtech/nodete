<b>Scenario</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	As described in the beginning of the tutorial, the health care provider requires to archive 
	data in a quarterly basis. It now reaches the time to perform the archive.
</p>


<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	Roll-out operation is demonatrated here.
	<ul>
	<li>Once a table has been defined with range partitioning, it takes only one command 
	to detach any partition; ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION ... TO TABLE</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<BR>

<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	The health care provider can now roll out data from 2009-01-01 to 2009-03-31 with the 
	ALTER TABLE ... DETACH command. The detached data is stored in the OPD_20090q1 table. 
	This table is like any other regular table that can be backed up as desired. <BR><BR>
	
	<B>Best Practices ::</B>
	<ul>
		<li> DETACH works faster than DELETE command as it does not hit the transaction log.</li>
		<li> With Local indexes in place, Asynchronus index clean is not required.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
