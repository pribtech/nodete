<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	On a daily basis, the clinic moves data to a data warehouse for data mining.
	The business intelligence team runs reports on the clinical data to mine for statistics.
</p>

<B>Pre-requistes</B><BR><BR>
<b>On Windows</b>
	<ul><li>
	Create directory 'XMLDataMoved_OPD' and
					 'XMLDataMoved_PD' in drive C:\ or in a path you like.
    </li></ul>
<BR>
<b>On UNIX/Linux</b>
	<ul>
	<li>
	Create directory 'XMLDataMoved_OPD' and
					 'XMLDataMoved_PD' in a path you like, e.g. /home/db2inst1/tmp.
	</li>
	<li>
	Give groups and others write and execute permission to these directory. e.g. On the console, enter <b>chmod -R 774 /home/db2inst1/tmp</b>.
	</li>
	<li> On the right pane, example of both Windows and Linux/UNIX based commands are shown. Click Edit Query, enable the commands you need by ensuring they are NOT commented by --, remove the other commands you don't need. Update the path accordingly.</li>

<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	DB2 data movement utilities such as EXPORT and IMPORT utilities are used to export and
	import regular and XML data.
</p>


<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p align = "justify">
	<ul>
		<li>
<B>Exporting XML data</B>
<P align = "justify">
XML data is moved into flat files in directories 'XMLDataMoved_OPD' and 'XMLDataMoved_PD' using the EXPORT utility.
<BR><BR>
The destination paths and base names of the exported XML files can be specified with the XML TO and XMLFILE
options. By default, exported XML files are written to the path of the exported data file. The default base name for
exported XML files is the name of the exported data file, with an appending 3-digit sequence number,
and the .xml extension.

		</li>
	<BR>
		<li>
<H4>Importing XML data</H4>
<P align = "justify">
The import utility is used to import XML data into an XML table column using either the table name or
a nickname for a DB2 Database for Linux, UNIX, and Windows source data object. When importing data into
an XML table column, you can use the XML FROM option to specify the paths of the input XML data file or files.
