<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
A patient, Oliver, returns to the hospital for a medical follow up. The doctor recommends for additional examination. Any changes to the patients medical status will trigger an additional PMD document for the patient.  
A copy of the existing PMD document together with the additional details will be created. 
This helps the health care provider to maintain the complete medical history of a patient in such a way that any 
point in time medical status can be easily retrieved. 
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	Insert a new PMD document with the TRANSFORM function. This function fetches an existing XML document, modifies the virtual copy of the document, and then inserts the updates, all in one statement.
	The output will show a additional component added at the end of the PMD (See result tab).
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The  XMLQUERY function fetches the PMD document.</li>
<li>The TRANSFORM function can do an INSERT, REPLACE or DELETE operation in a XML document.</li>
<li><b><code>do insert</code></b> inserts a node to the existing PMD document.</li>
<li><b><code>do replace</code></b> replace a part of the node or edits a node.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
 	A new PMD is created for Oliver with all the medical history and the latest recommendations from the doctor.
</p>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<li>When updating multiple elements of an XML document, combine the updates into a single transform expression (insert and replace in our example) to help obtain significantly increased update performance.</li>
