<H4>Inserting XML data into XML columns</H4>
<P align="justify">

The pureXML technology in DB2 9 only parses XML documents at insert time so that they are stored and queried in a parsed format. This is denoted in DB2 9 by the use of
the new XML data type. The parsed format is a tree structure of nodes as explained in page 2 "XML document tree storage".


<H4>Inserting XML data into CLOB columns</H4>

XML documents can be stored in CLOB columns. They are inserted as unparsed text objects. No XML parsing at insert time can be a performance benefit, especially in CPU-bound systems.

<h4>Performance comparison between XML inserts and CLOB inserts</h4>
<P align="justify">
On the right pane, click the buttons in order to obtain an average insert times for XML data in XML columns and CLOB columns. Theoretically you should see CLOB inserts is faster than XML inserts. However you may see the opposite in this sample due to insufficient amount of data.

<!--
Avoiding XML parsing at insert time can be a performance benefit,
especially in CPU-bound systems. However, without XML parsing, the structure of the XML
documents is entirely ignored. This precludes the database from performing intelligent
and efficient search and extract operations on the stored text objects. The only remedy
is to invoke the XML parser at query execution time to "look into" the XML documents such
that search conditions can be evaluated. The significant CPU consumption of XML parsing
often leads to low search and extract performance. Only a blind full document retrieval,
which again ignores the internal XML structure, can quickly read XML documents from CLOB
columns.
