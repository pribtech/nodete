<H4>Storing XML as Character Large OBject (CLOB)</H4>
<P align="justify">
<BR>
Before DB2 9, CLOB columns were a common choice to store XML data.
A fundamental difference between CLOB storage and pureXML processing lies in
XML parsing and its significant impact on insert and query performance.

Refer to the example on the right to see how XML documents can be stored in CLOB.

<!--
CLOB storage offers good performance for insert and full document retrieval, typically
at the cost of poor search and extract performance. The XML data type in DB2 9 sacrifices some of the
insert and retrieval performance for much higher search and extract performance. This is a reasonable
trade-off because business data is more often searched and analyzed than inserted. Typically, there is
one insert and multiple searches. Additionally, the potential overhead of XML columns is often outweighed
by the fact that XML columns are buffered in the buffer pool while CLOB columns are not.
