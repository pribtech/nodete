<p><b>Scenario</b></p>
<p>
	The health care provider needs to find all the patients who had treated by a doctor Durenda. Doctor's informaion and reports are stored in the PMD documents in XML format.
</p>
<p><b>Operation</b></p>
<p>
	The XMLEXISTS predicate checks for the condition specified and returns a boolean accordingly. The example on the right shows that XMLEXISTS returns 'true' if the doctor's given name is 'Durenda' and 'false' if otherwise.

</p>
<p><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
Patients treated by doctor Durenda are returned.
</p>
<p><b>Best Practices</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use the XMLEXISTS predicate in the SQL WHERE clause to
specify predicates over XML data to help improve query
performance by examining fewer rows. </li>
</ul>
