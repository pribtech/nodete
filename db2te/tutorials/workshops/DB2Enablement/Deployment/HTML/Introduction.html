<H2>Step 4: Production Deployment</H2><HR>
<p>
After completing the testing of your application on DB2, next step is to <b class="sourceChange">deploy your DB2 products</b>.

<H2>Deployment</H2><HR>
<p>
	Planning the deployment of DB2 based solutions among various operating
	system platforms and DB2 products might appear be a complex endeavor. 
	This tutorial briefly describes the different methodology for deploying the 
	DB2 family of products on Linux, UNIX, and Windows platforms across multiple computers 
	quickly, easily, and consistently. <br><br>
	The first step in deployment planning is choosing the right product.
	After selecting the right product, the next step is to deploy it on machines. Installing 
a product on a single machine will not take much time and effort however deploying the
product on mass level might be challenging as each machines will take lot of time and effort.

<br>
The steps to install and deploy DB2 product differ by platform, the overall steps are:
<ol>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Planing your deployment</li>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Creating a response file</li>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Creating a deployment script or definition</li>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Running the deployment script or definition on all computers</li>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Reducing the size of installation image</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Figure in the right pane illustrates an environment topology. There are Seven AIX boxes (Box A,
	B, C, D, E, F, G) targeted for deployment. All the systems have the same operating system and the same version of DB2. The DB2 installation image is on
	Box A, which acts as a file server. Deployment
	script executed from Box A will send commands to Box B, C, D, E, F, G across the network.  Box A is set-up as a Network File System (NFS) server 
	and  Box B, C, D, E, F, G act as NFS clients. Therefore Box B, C, D, E, F, G can access the DB2 installation image on Box A 
	through the network.<br>
