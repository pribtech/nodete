<H2>Deployment Package or Script</H2><HR>
The next step in deployment process after creating the response file is creating and running the deployment script.
<p>
	To deploy DB2 products to another computer, you must create a package using a software deployment tool 
	or create a script that you can run on the computer. This section describes how to create a package 
	using <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://www.microsoft.com/technet/downloads/sms.mspx');"><b>SMS</b></a> 
	on Windows and how to create a deployment script on Linux and UNIX platforms.

	<li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Packaging IBM Data Server products using SMS</b></li>
	To package IBM data server products you must have SMS 2003 installed and configured on your network 
	for both your SMS 2003 server and your SMS 2003 client workstations. For more details on how to configure

	<br><br><li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Creating a deployment script</b></li>
	The deployment script can be written as a shell script or in Perl, 
	Java,  C or batch files. These script act as a wrapper to handle aspects of DB2 
	installation and configuration that the DB2 installation procedure does not handle. 
	You run the script on the target computer as part of the deployment process. <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('ftp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/SG247653/');"><b>Click here</b></a> to download sample 
	deployment script that comes with <B>DB2 Deployment Guide </B>. For DB2 Deployment Guide check the reference part in the last page.
	<br><br><li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Deploying a response file installation</b></li>
	Deploying a response file installation is the easiest of all installation as the product definition, the selection of components, 
	and the setting up of instances are almost completely encapsulated by the response file. 
</ul>

<br><br><H2>Running Deployment Script</H2><HR><BR>
Previous sections provided the steps to prepare for deployment. 
You can perform these steps once, incurring the upfront preparation costs, and then deploy to hundreds or 
thousands of computers. You can add extra computers later with almost no additional preparation.

There are two basic styles of deployment: <b>Push</b> and <b>Pull</b>.
<ol>
	<br><li class="sourceCopiedFrom"><b>Push</b>:-</li>
	In a push deployment, a centralized location initiates the contact with each computer. This is usually suitable for cases 
	where a centralized IT department wants to set up many computers without any user action.
	<br><br><li class="sourceCopiedFrom"><b>Pull</b>:-</li>
	In a pull deployment, each location in which a DB2 product is being installed initiates its own contact 
	with the server to start the installation. Often, this operation is done using a link on a Web page or 
	in an e-mail. This style is suitable for cases where very few computers require a DB2 product 
	installation or no automated service is available to initiate a push installation.

	With SMS, you can set up the installation of DB2 or IBM Data Server products from a central location, 
	and install it in an efficient and reliable manner across a computer network. For more details
