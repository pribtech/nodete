<H2>Deployment Planning</H2><HR>
<p>
The second step in planning is selecting the right installation method. After installation the next step is to apply the DB2 licenses.
</p>

<H2>Installation Methods</H2><HR><BR>
<p>
	You can install Data Server products non-interactively in a number of ways. 
	Which method you choose depends on your preference, platform, and in some cases, 
	product. You can use all methods interchangeably. That is, you can use one installation 
	method now and then later use a different installation method on the same computer. 
	Choosing one method does not commit you to the continued use of that method.

<li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Unattended installation using a response file:-</b></li>
This method involves creating a response file and then running the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0008889.html');"><b>db2setup</b></a>
or <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0011768.html');"><b>setup</b></a> command using that response file.

<br><br><li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Unattended installation using the db2_install script:-</b></li>
The <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0023669.html');"><b>db2_install</b></a> script is a thin, coarse wrapper that calls the response 
file installer to install the entire product. 
Compared to a response file installation, this method has some limitations.

<br><br><li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">Payload file deployment:-</b></li>
A payload file is a compressed tar archive that contains all of the files and
metadata for an installable component. This method extracts component files
from the payload file, directly saves them into the target path, then uses db2chgpath
to update the embedded runtime path. This deployment method is for the
advanced user only and is not a recommended installation method.

<span style="background-color: green"><b>Note:</b></span> You can also use the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0025270.html');"><b>db2iprune</b></a> 
command to reduce the size of a DB2 database product installation image. Refer to <B> Reduce Installation Image Size </B> section for more details.

<BR><BR><H2>Applying DB2 license files to images</H2><HR><BR>
To use DB2 server products you must obtain the appropriate licenses 
for each computer you will deploy it on. You might also have to obtain a license 
for a particular feature that you wish to use.<br>
When the image is installed, the licenses are automatically installed. To verify that a license has been installed, 
you can run <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0002451.html');"><b>db2licm -l</b></a> and review the output.
