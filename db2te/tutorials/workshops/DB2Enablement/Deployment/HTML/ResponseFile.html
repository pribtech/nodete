<H2>Response File</H2><HR>
<p>
	The next step in the DB2 product deployment is to create a <b class="sourceChange">response file</b>. 
	A response file is used to tell the installation process what to install and how to configure it. 
	Using response file can simplify the installation 
	script considerably by reducing the number of commands that must be run after the installation.
	You can create a response file using below methods:-

	The easiest way to create a response file is using the DB2 Setup wizard. 
	You can use this GUI wizard to go through the installation and then save the response file. 
	This method enables you to easily select which components you want to install and what configuration 
	options you want.

	After installing your DB2 product, you can create a response file using the DB2 response file 
	generator utility, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0007509.html');"><b>db2rspgn</b></a>. The db2rspgn utility takes a snapshot of your product installation 
	and configuration settings. This utility saves this information in a response file and in a 
	configuration profile. This utility is not available for the Data Server Driver.

	You can also create a response file by copying one of the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/r0007504.html');"><b>sample response files</b></a> from the DVD and 
	modifying it. Samples are typically available in the <b class="sourceChange">db2/platform/samples</b> directory, 
	where platform is the platform identifier.
</ol>	
	<br>
	After successful creation of response file from the above methods the next step is to modify the response file.
	A response file can be easy to use, although you should test it prior to deploying it across a large enterprise.
	According to the requirement you can modify the response file.
