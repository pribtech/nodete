<H2>Running Oracle schema creation scripts in DB2</H2><HR>
<p>Schema enablement for DB2 is as easy as running the Oracle schema creation scripts in DB2. The example on the right pane contains tables and some other database schema described in the data model.

<p>
Enabling your Oracle database and application to run with DB2 9.7 begins with
the deployment of the table schema, followed by the movement of the table data
and the deployment of procedural objects. 
</p>
<p>
Table schema objects include table,
index and constraint definitions, and procedural objects include PL/SQL
packages, procedures, functions, and triggers.
</p>

<p>
IBM provides a set of tools that simplify and semi-automate the process. 
The available tools are:-
<ul>
<li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">IBM Data Movement Tool</b>- Used for moving large amount of DDLs, table data, and PL/SQL objects from an other database to a DB2 database. </li>
<li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">IBM Optim Data Studio</b>-  Used for moving DDLs, table data, and PL/SQL objects from an other database to a DB2 database but it's not a high speed data movement tool for large amount of data.</li>
<li><b class="sourceCopiedFrom">IBM DB2 Meet</b>-  Used for evaluating PL/SQL compatibility ratio. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can find the detail information about these tools in the <b>Enablement Tools</b> under <b>Enablement Resource</b> section.
