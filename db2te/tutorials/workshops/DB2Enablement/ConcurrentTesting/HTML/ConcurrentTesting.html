<H2>Step 3: Concurrent Testing</H2><HR>
<p>
The next step after successfully enabling and testing the Pl/SQL packages is to test the packages in the <br><b class="sourceChange">multiuser environment</b>.

<p>
Software and system implementations are not complete without proper testing and quality assurance. Multi-user concurrent testing must be performed to discover any problems revealed only in concurrent mode. While it is not possible to execute a complete multi-user test plan here in the workshop, it is worthwhile to point out some behavior you may encounter with concurrent testing.

Database schema and PL/SQL packages must be created before proceeding further. If you have not already done so, you can run the SQL script on the right to satisfy the pre-requisites of this tutorial. Note that if database objects already exist, you will receive error.
