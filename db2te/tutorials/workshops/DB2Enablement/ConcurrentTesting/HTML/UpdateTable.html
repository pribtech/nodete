<H2><B>Create procedures to update the tables</B></H2><HR>
<p>
	In a typical production environment Users(USER A and USER B) use stored procedures to perform UPDATE operations against database. 
	To demonstrate the currently committed behavior you will create two stored procedures, 
	<b class="sourceCopiedFrom">update_customer_info()</b> to update customer information and <b class="sourceCopiedFrom">update_product_price()</b> to update product information. 
	USER A and USER B call these stored procedures via action buttons to update the tables in the next page. 
	On right pane click on Run Button to create the procedures.
