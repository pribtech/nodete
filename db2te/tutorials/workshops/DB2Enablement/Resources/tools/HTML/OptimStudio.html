<H2>IBM Optim Development Studio</H2><HR>
<p>
<b class="sourceChange">Optim Developer Studio</b> is primarily a development
environment and not a high speed data movement tool for large amount of data.
Optim Developer Studio focuses on portable ways of moving data (mainly SQL
statements) between RDBMS, and is useful during development
of a new database application or while extending an existing one. Application
developers can work concurrently on other databases or DB2 database for
development.

Optim Developer Studio is useful when the data to be transferred is small to
medium size (a few GB). This is handy for test databases or when longer data
transfer times are acceptable.

<H2>Moving DDLs and data</H2><HR>
<p>
You can use the ODS Data Source Explorer panel (Figure 1-2) to concurrently
connect to both Oracle and DB2. After the connections are established, you can
use standard drag and drop techniques to easily move database objects such as
tables (including data), procedures, and so on, from one database to the other.
This technique does not allow you to make any changes to the definitions before
deployment.
</p>

<H2>Deploying PL/SQL objects</H2><HR>
<p>
Optim Development Studio also offers capabilities of deploying PL/SQL objects
into DB2. Advantage of Optim is that you can deploy PL/SQL just by dragging
and dropping the objects from Oracle to DB2 on the same panel without any
intermediate steps.
