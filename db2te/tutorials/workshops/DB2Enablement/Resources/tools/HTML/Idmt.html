<H2>IBM Data Movement Tool</H2><HR>
<p>
The <b class="sourceChange">IBM Data Movement Tool</b> (<a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?lang=en_US&source=idmt&S_TACT=105AGX11&S_CMP=ART');"><b>IDMT</b></a>) is the tool of choice for moving schema and
data efficiently between Oracle as a source and DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows (LUW) 
as a target. This tool also supports many other databases as a source, including 
Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Access.
</p>
<p>
IDMT uses a series of Java programs and shell scripts (Windows or UNIX) 
to access the source Oracle database and generate database scripts necessary to
recreate the objects in DB2. It also extracts the data from the source Oracle
tables using a multi-threaded technique and generates scripts to populate DB2
tables with the extracted data using the very fast

utility.

<H2>Moving DDLs and data</H2><HR>
<p>
In order to move the data from Oracle source database to DB2 target database,
the DMT requires connection information both for Oracle and DB2.
The extraction process retrieves the original Oracle data definitions (DDL), and
can also automatically modify the code to make it more compatible with DB2.
<b><i>Figure 1</i></b> on the right pane shows the GUI screen of DMT 
with required fields.

<H2>Deploying PL/SQL objects</H2><HR>
<p>
The IDMT can also be used for deployment of PL/SQL
objects such as triggers, functions, procedures and packages. The PL/SQL
source code is extracted as part of the Extract DDL/Data operation when the
DDL check box is checked (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b> on the right pane).
Once the Extract DDL operation is complete, the extracted DDL and PL/SQL
become visible on the Interactive Deploy panel (<b><i>Figure 2</b></i> on right pane) after
pressing the Refresh button.
