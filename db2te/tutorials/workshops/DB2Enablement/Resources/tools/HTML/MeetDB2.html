<H2>IBM MEET DB2</H2><HR>
<p>
IBM has created an internal utility named <b class="sourceChange">MEET DB2</b> that can analyze all the
objects in your Oracle database and score it. It produces a report of what will
work out of the box and where adjustments need to be made. Your IBM account
representative or sales contact can run this utility to help quickly provide a
compatibility assessment of your current Oracle database with DB2.
The utility is simple to run, accepting text as input, and rapidly producing an
HTML report that summarizes the compatibility of the DDL and procedural
objects in the input. The analysis provide detailed insight about the
level of compatibility that DB2 can provide for the database definitions and
objects defined in the Oracle source database.
