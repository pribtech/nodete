<H2>Enablement process</H2><HR>

<p>The fundamental steps of database enablement are covered in this workshop.</p>
	<b class="sourceChange">Step 1: Schema Enablement</b><BR>
					The first step in the enablement process is to move the database schema objects and data from other vendor to DB2.<p><br>
	<b class="sourceChange">Step 2: Business Logic (PL/SQL) Enablement</b><br>
					Once you have the database schema and data created in DB2, you should then enable database application objects which have encapsulated the business logic. This workshop demonstrates enablement of database application object written in PL/SQL language.<p><br>
	<b class="sourceChange">Step 3: Concurrent Testing</b><br>
					Software and system implementations are not complete without proper testing and quality assurance. Multi-user concurrent testing must be performed to discover any problems revealed only in concurrent mode. This workshop demonstrates use of simple scripts for concurrent application usage scenarios.<p><br>
	<b class="sourceChange">Step 4: Production Deployment</b><br>
					When a software or system has reached functional and quality satisfaction, it may have concluded its development cycle. However ease of product deployment (especially massive deployment) is often being neglected. This step reinforces the importance of deployment and shows few of many different options DB2 has provided in the deployment area.<p><br>
	<b class="sourceChange">Step 5: Online Database Maintenance</b><br>
					Your product's life does not end the day after it is deployed. There are often still many maintenance and enhancements needs to be made to the product. In this last step of the workshop, you will see few online database maintenance features DB2 has offered. They allow you to perform database related changes and yet will not interrupt your database availability.<p><br>
