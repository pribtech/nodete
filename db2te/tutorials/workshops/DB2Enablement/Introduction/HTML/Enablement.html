<H2>Business Problem:- Increasing cost pressures</H2><HR>
<p><b class="sourceChange">Increased cost pressure</b> forces companies to ensure investments spent on their information and infrastructure 
have maximum value returned. Many companies realize that IBM DB2 is the database management system of choice 
for relieving cost pressures, helping to deliver greater business value with low operational costs, high 
reliability and increased ease of use.</p>

<p class="sourceChange"><b>Customers who want to migrate their databases to DB2 often find challenges in
migrating database schema and tables because vendor specific data types are used. 
Application code or stored procedures are also typically coded in vendor specific language.</b></p>
This requires different skill sets and large effort to port the database application layer to work with DB2</p>.
