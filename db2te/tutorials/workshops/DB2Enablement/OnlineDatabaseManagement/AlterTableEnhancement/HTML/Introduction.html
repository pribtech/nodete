<H2>Step 5: Database Maintenance</H2><HR>
<p>
	At the final step of the enablement process, you have already enabled and deployed 
	your application with DB2. There are often maintenance and enhancements need to be 
	made to the product. In this tutorial, you will see few <br><b class="sourceChange">online database maintenance</b> 
	features DB2 offers. These features allow you to perform database related changes and yet 
	will not interrupt your database availability.

<p>
	Around-the-clock availability is always desirable. However, it is not always cost 
	effective for any type of business to have a <b class="sourceCopiedFrom">99.99% availability</b> strategy. 
	While it is usually costly to implement a high availability system to recover the 
	system when there is an outage, you should use products that offer features to 
	minimize planned outages such as maintenance activities. DB2 provides a set of routine 
	maintenance tasks that you can perform while the database is online.

	If you have not already done so, you can run the SQL script on the right to satisfy the 
	pre-requisites of this tutorial. Note that if database objects already exist, you will 
	receive error.
