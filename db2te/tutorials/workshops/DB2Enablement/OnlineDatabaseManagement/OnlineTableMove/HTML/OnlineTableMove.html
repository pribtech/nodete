<H2>Scenario</H2><HR>
<p class="sourceChange"><b>
	Company's database server located at Toronto and users from US, India
	and from other locations are accessing this database. Tablespace TBS1 in a 
	database is full and DBA cannot add any more disk to the containers, DBA              decided to move to a different tablespaces with new container storage                    without making any outages.</b>
</p>	


<BR><H2>Problem</H2><HR>
<p>
	To move to a different tablespaces DBA has to offline the database, that will 
	cause the loss of million dollars to the company.
</P	
	

<BR><H2>Solution</H2><HR>
<p>
	Starting from DB2 9.7 you can move tables by using an online or offline move 
	using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dm.doc/doc/t0054864.html');"><b>ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE</b></a> procedure. The <b class="sourceChange">ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE</b> stored procedure 
	moves the data in an active table into a new table object with the same name, 
	while the data remains online and available for access. Use an online table move 
	instead of an offline table move if you value availability more than cost, space, move 
	performance, and transaction overhead.
</p>
<img width="350" src="?BASE_DIRECTORY?HTML/OnlineTableMove.PNG"/><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
	You can move a table online by calling the stored procedure once or multiple times, 
	one call for each operation performed by the procedure. Using multiple calls provides 
	you with additional options, such as cancelling the move or controlling when the 
	target table is taken offline to be updated.
</p>	

<H2>Prerequisite</H2><HR>
<p>
	Ensure there is sufficient disk space to accommodate the copies of the table 
	and index, the staging table, and the additional log entries.
