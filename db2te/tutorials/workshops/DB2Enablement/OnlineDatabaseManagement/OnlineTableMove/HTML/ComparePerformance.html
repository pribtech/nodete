You can also move the table with LOAD option.
</p>
<p>
	This example moves the same ORDER_DETAILS table, but it uses the LOAD option instead of the INSERT FROM
	CURSOR option, which is the default. Many factors contribute to making the LOAD option faster than INSERT FROM
	CURSOR option:
	<ul>
	<li>LOAD does not log the changes on the target per record.</li>
	<li>LOAD is highly parallelized for CPU and I/O processing.</li>
	<li>LOAD performs large block writes to the target table. This provides additional I/O efficiencies.</li>
	</ul>
<p/>
<p>
	Here you will move table ORDER_DETAILS to tablespace TBS3 using INSERT FROM CURSOR option and
	after that you will move the table ORDER_DETAILS to tablespace TBS2 with LOAD option. 
	After the successful movement of table you will compare the results.
