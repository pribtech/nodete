<H2>Move Table Online</H2><HR>
<p>
	<b>ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE</b> creates a copy of the source table. The data is copied by using either 
	<b>INSERT FROM CURSOR</b>, which is the default, or LOAD. While the table is being moved, 
	the ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE routine also creates a staging table that keeps track of all changes to the source table. 
	Changes are tracked through triggers that are created on the source table. At the end of the move operation, 
	the ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE routine briefly locks the source table in exclusive mode, catches up with updates that have 
	occurred, and substitutes the source table with the target. The source table is either dropped 
	or kept based on one of the ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE input parameters.
