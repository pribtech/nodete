<H2>Database object dependencies</H2><HR>
In DB2 database objects are dependent on each other. Like views depends on a table, 
stored procedures depends on the table or views or functions and so on. So if you are trying to create a view 
then ideally the corresponding table should exist on the database but if the table is not there and you want to create
a view then how will you create a view ? Refer to the following table and view dependencies.

	Beginning with version 9.7 you can configure DB2 to allow creation of objects 
	with certain types of warning such as missing dependent objects. 
	This capability can be useful for database object creation, design,
	and modification because it permits you to have a random order of 
	CREATE commands. It also allows you to verify the syntax of new views
	and procedures without creating the objects they depend on. 
	With DB2 9.7 objects can be <a class="sourceCopiedFrom" onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/c0055269.html');"><b>revalidated automatically</b></a>. <p class="sourceChange">With DB2 9.7 user can create the views and tables in any order they like, object revalidation will happen automatically.</p class="sourceChange">

<p>
	This tutorial requires that the <b class="sourceChange">AUTO_REVAL</b> database configuration parameter be set to <b class="sourceChange">DEFERRED_FORCE</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">You can set this parameter to <b class="sourceChange">DEFERRED</b>. With this value all dependent objects are revalidated the next time that they are accessed.</li><br>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">You can set this parameter to <b class="sourceChange">DEFERRED_FORCE</b>. This value behaves the same way as when it is set to DEFERRED and an additional CREATE with <span style="background-color: ORANGE"><b>warning</b></span> feature is enabled.</li><br>
<li class="sourceCopiedFrom">You can set this parameter to <b class="sourceChange">IMMEDIATE</b>. With this value all dependent objects will be revalidated immediately after objects are invalidated. </li>
</ul>
</p>
	
<p>
	The view to the right pane displays the current value. If it is not set to DEFERRED_FORCE, you can press
	the change button and change it to DEFERRED_FORCE.
