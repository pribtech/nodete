<p>
	You can see the views created successfully in the right pane despite the warnings that
	were issued.  The views have not been validated yet, they are in invalid state. 
	The DB2 database will invalidate objects if a dependent object is changed.
	This is because we have the AUTO_REVAL database configuration value set to DEFERRED_FORCE. 
	If the AUTO_REVAL database configuration value was set to <b>IMMEDIATE</b> the revalidation would occur 
	as soon as any changes to the view or dependent objects	are made. You should see the 
	views in the right pane. There should be <b class="sourceChange">'N'</b> in the <b class="sourceChange">'Valid'</b> column.
