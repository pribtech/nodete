<p>
	The views have been successfully created, but not yet validated.  
	Validation in this instance won't occur until the user 
	runs a statement against the invalid view. To do this, you will 
	run the <b>SELECT</b> statement against the created view. <p class="sourceChange">This <b>SELECT</b> will
	fetch the random registered customer who will get the bonanza gift and also validate the view</p>
