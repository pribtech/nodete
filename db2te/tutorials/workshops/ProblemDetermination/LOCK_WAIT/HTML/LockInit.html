<p>
	Run the query on the right. You should see two returned values.
</p>
<p>
	In this step you will see the values of <b>LOCK_WAITS</b> and <b>LOCK_WAIT_TIME_PERCENT</b> when your system is idle. Because these are snapshot values, you may get a slightly different result when you execute the query at different time.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>LOCK_WAITS</b> is the number of times that an application has waited for locks.</li>
    <li><b>LOCK_WAIT_TIME_PERCENT</b> is the percentage of time spent waiting within the DB2 database server that was spent waiting on locks.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Try executing the query a couple of times to get a rough idea of their idle values.
