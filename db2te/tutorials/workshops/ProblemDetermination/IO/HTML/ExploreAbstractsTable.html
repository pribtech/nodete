<p>Run the query in the Ad Hoc command window on your right.</p>

<p>As you can see in the Ad Hoc command window, we have to cast the data from the abstract column we inserted in the step before into a <em>VARCHAR</em> type. Without this, the data would be displayed as <em>(CLOB)</em> and could not be read. You can try changing the parameter of the <em>VARCHAR</em> to display more characters from the CLOB column. You can also remove the whole casting to see what looks like a CLOB column without it.</p>
