<H3>Configure the db2auth_key.txt</H3><hr>
<p>This is the file that the plug-in gathers information about where to get the authorization data from.
It also gets group name to set SYSADM to, as well as the user name (and password in some cases) of the administrator.
</p>
<H2>Steps:</H2><p>
<ol><li>Make a copy of the db2auth_key.txt.empty file, and rename it as db2auth_key.txt.</li><br/>
<li>Open the db2auth_key.txt file.  
You should see two sample configuration lines: 
<ul># Sample showing connection to local authentication database</ul>
<ul>#   localDB db2admns db2admin</ul>
<ul># Sample showing connection to remote authentication database</ul>
<ul>#   remoteDB db2admns db2admin db2adminpw</ul>
<br/>This configuration follows the format: 
<br/>[name of (remote or local) db to store authorization info] [SYSADM admin group name] [admin user ID] ([admin password (only for remote db)])
</li><br/>
<li>Copy the appropriate sample line, and replace it with names of your choice (and without the # sign).  The admin user ID should be the name with the necessary authorization, as verified in step three.
<ul><br/><li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Fill the password parameter <b>only if</b> the database where the authorization information is stored is <b>not local to the instance</b> that you are configuring the plug-in for. In that case, the file should be configured so that only the DB2 instance owner can access the file.
</p>
</li></ul></li></ol></p>
