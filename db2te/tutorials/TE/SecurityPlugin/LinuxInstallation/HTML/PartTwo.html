<H3>All-in-One Interactive Installation</H3><hr>
<p>The plug-in needs to store authentication data in a database.  If this database is <b>remote</b> to the DB2 instance that you are configuring this plug-in for, you must do a <b>manual</b> installation.  Go on to the next page.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the authentication database is <b>local</b>, you can do a manual installation, or use the all-in-one interactive installation program, 'DO_IT_ALL_LOCAL.'

<H2>Steps:</H2><p>
<ol><li>Make sure you are logged on to the termianl as the DB2 instance owner, and open a bash or ksh shell terminal.
</li><br/>
<li>Invoke the script, 'DO_IT_ALL_LOCAL'</li><br/>
<li>Follow the prompts, which will take you through the complete configuration process.
</li><br/>
<li>If the program finished successfully, you have finished installing and configuring the plug-in.  Otherwise, follow the uninstallation steps in part 6 of this tutorial, and try a manual install.
