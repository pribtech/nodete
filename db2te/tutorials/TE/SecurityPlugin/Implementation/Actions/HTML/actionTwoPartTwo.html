<h3>Retrieving Row Information for Editing</h3><hr/>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done when editing anything is to retrieve all editable information from the database. </p>

<p>The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy the action 'remove member', which we created below, and make the highlighted changes on the right.</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right
  <br/>Differences from the 'remove member' action is highlighted in yellow</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Notice that the action type of 'getNewPasswordForm' is 'form'.  We need the user to input the new password via a form.  The form is created with the 'CDATA' tag, as shown on the right.  The variable, 'PASSWORD_1' is assigned that new password from the form.</p>

<p>We also need to hash the new password.  Therefore, in the followOnAction, we specify the action, 'hash', and pass in 'PASSWORD_1' to the action</p>

<p>Once the password has been successfully hashed, we assign it to 'PASSWORD_2'</p>
