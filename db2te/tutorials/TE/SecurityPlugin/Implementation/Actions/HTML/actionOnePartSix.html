<h3>Completing the Delete</h3><hr/>
<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Before the user/membership/group can be removed, another action is required to ask for task removal on the server. </p>

<p>The action type to call back to a JSON server action is 'serverAction'. </p>

<p>When parameters were introduced earlier, parameter lists were also mentioned. A 'parameterList' contains a series of 'parameter' elements used to assign local parameters. Keep in mind that all local and shared parameters are shipped across to the server automatically so it is a good idea not to put anything too large into a shared parameter. </p>

<p><h2>The parameters:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first parameter that is assigned indicates which JSON server action is to be run </p>
<li>The second parameter contains the values and names of the variables for the SQL action</p>
<li>The third parameter contains the SQL to be executed </p>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> There is slight distinction between the parameter types 'raw' and 'fixed'. A type 'fixed' will perform a parameter marker substitution whereas a type of 'raw' will not.</p>
