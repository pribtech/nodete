<h3>Parameter Checking</h3><hr/>
<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right</li>
  <li>Check your work (you may not want to delete the user/membership/group quite yet), then reload the panel containing the Db2auth Custom Master View or open it again from your menu item</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<p>A check is similar to a follow-on action, but the condition can only be compared against the value which has just been assigned to the parameter. Checks execute their tasks 'onMatch' or 'onNonMatch' of their respective condition. </p>

<p>Here, the check is checking for a error message strings or blank strings and will enter on match.</p>
