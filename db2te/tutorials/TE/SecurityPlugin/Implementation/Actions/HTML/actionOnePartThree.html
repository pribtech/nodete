<p><h4>What are Follow-on actions?</h4>
Follow-on actions are logical control structures containing groups of multiple tasks to be executed in a given condition.</p>

<p>Follow-on actions are structured so that the 'condition' attribute of the follow-on action will contain a regular expression that will be matched against a given variable. By default, only this attribute is required. The condition will be compared against the return code of the action if no other source for comparison is specified.  It is expected that on an action success, the return code will be a string value of 'true'. </p>
