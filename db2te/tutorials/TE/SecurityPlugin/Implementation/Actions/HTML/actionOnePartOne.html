<h3>Defining an Action</h3><hr/>
<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right</li>
  <li>Check your work, then reload the panel containing the Task Scheduler or open it again from your menu item</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h4>What are actions? </h4>
Actions are XML scripts which allow you to define a set of trigger driven client/server events. You can use a simple XML script to string together a set of complicated predefined events to accomplish any number of tasks. </p>
</p>

<p>The first action you are creating is to load two pages with details from the main view. You want the action to act on each individual row. Inside the 'display_columns' element, add an additional 'col' element in 'action' type to display a trigger for each row. The trigger will then execute the action against its associated row. </p>

<p>The 'col' element attribute 'type' will have a value 'action' to indicate that this column is going to call an action. The attribute 'name' will be set to the same name as the action it is to call.</p>

<p>The action framework will be defined on this page. The element 'c_title' is set to the column title, and the element 'icon' is set to the file name of the icon to be displayed for the trigger.</p>
