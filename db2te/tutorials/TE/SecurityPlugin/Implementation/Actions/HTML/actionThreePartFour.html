<h3>The Add Membership Action Script</h3><hr/>
<p>The add membership action is almost exactly like the add user function. Copy the entire 'getNameForNewGroup' action from the edit function into the 'menu' element.</p>

<p>Like we did with the add group function, we will use a pre-defined form, located in [your_TE_folder]/tableDefinitions/Db2auth/addGroupMember.xml</p>
