<p>The element 'actionScript' is the base for the action's script. All actions have an attribute 'name', used as a callback identifier to store and retrieve information returned from the action. It is always a good idea to keep these names unique throughout a script. The next attribute is 'type' which indicates the action type to run. <!--The available action types are listed here.--> Although the use of a type 'blank' might seem odd at first, it is useful to set up variables or to define actions that need to be called multiple times--like functions. In this case only some local tasks need to be performed.
