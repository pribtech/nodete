<H3>Loading a Panel</H3><hr>
<p>To actually display content you need to define a 'panel'. Panels have the ability to load and display data from the server, and refresh themselves. Panels can also load other layouts, or raw data. They will can page titles, and build and promote menus for a given page. Basically, panels take care of getting your content on the screen.</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make the changes to your 'menu_01_Db2auth.xml' document as indicated on the right</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The attribute 'name' represents a unique name for a panel within a given window. The name is used so that links can target a given location and load data within. If you try to load a link into a window where a panel of the given name does not exist, the window will clear itself and create a panel of the given name.</p>
