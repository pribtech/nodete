<H3>Check Your Menu Item</H3><hr>
<p>Now that you have finished with the menu files, you will need to go to File->'Reload Menu' within the Technology Explorer, not your browser.</p>

<p>If everything worked, you should see a new menu after 'Help' called 'Db2auth Plug-in Lab'. Go ahead and open up the module. </p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to File->'Reload Menu' within the Technology Explorer (not your browser)</li>
  <li>Open up the new menu item and keep it open to check your work as we proceed with the lab </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>You may have noticed that this is not quite what the actual 'Db2auth Plug-in Control' menu under 'Tools' loads.  This will be covered in section '3. Stages', and in section '6. Menus' with Actions of this tutorial.
