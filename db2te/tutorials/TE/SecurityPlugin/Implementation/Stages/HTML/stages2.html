<H3>Setting Up the Layout Script</H3><hr>
<p>We want to build a stage to contain four tabs(windows): Users, Groups, Memberships, and Master View.</p>

<p>To do this, we need to set up a php script for layout.    
</p>
<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create the file 'db2AuthOverviewLab.php' in the directory [your_TE_folder]/actions/noConnection/HTML/
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The panelID, windowID, stageID, and pageID are for TE to keep track of which panel, window, stage, and page actions are called from.
</p>
<p>When a new main tab(window) loads containing this stage, we want it to have a name.  In this case, the title will be called 'Db2Auth Lab Control Panel'
</p>
<p>Finally, we need to specify that the rest of this file will be written in javascript.
