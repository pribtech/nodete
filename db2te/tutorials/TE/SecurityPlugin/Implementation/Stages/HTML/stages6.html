<H3>The Groups, Memberships, and Master View</H3><hr>
<p>The Groups, Memberships, and Master View windows are exactly the same as that of Users except for two places:
<ul>
<li>the 'target' variable (to define a unique window target)</li>
<li>the 'table' variable (to specify which table definition file to load)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The differences are highlighted in the right.</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
