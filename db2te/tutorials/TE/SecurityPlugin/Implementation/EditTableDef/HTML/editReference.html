<h3>Adding a Reference</h3><hr/>
<p>Many of the pages in the Technology Explorer include references to related tables. For example, the Columns pages, the Indexes page, and the Table Privileges page all include a reference link to the Table page to display the table related to the column, index or privilege. </p>

</p>
<p>
In this example, you will create a reference to the table defined in the Authority/authids.xml file.</p>
<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<p><h4>Descriptions of edits being made:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We need to define what the column type ('reference') and names are of the new columns to display</li>
<li>The references need to be defined, just like other columns
<ul><li>Here, both are referencing the table, 'Authority/authids' which is an XML table definition file in [your_TE_directory]/tableDefinitions/Authority folder
</li>
<li>In the first reference, we are matching 'userid' from our table definition to the 'authid' in 'Authority/authids'</li>
<li>In the second reference, we are matching 'groupid' from our table definition to the 'authid' in 'Authority/authids'</li>
</ul></p>
