<h3>Menu Items that Perform Actions Prior to Loading the Page</h3><hr/>
<p>Now that you know about actions, we can put some in our menu item, to perform some checks prior to loading the page.
</p>

<p>We will have the menu item perform two checks:
<ul>
  <li>Check the number of stored procedures there are under the 'DB2AUTH' schema (the db2auth plug-in creates 7)</li>
  <li>Check the existance of the DB2AUTH.USERS table</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If either of these two checks fail, we will configure the menu to pop up an error message.</p>

<p><h4>Color scheme reminder:</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="sourceRemove">Indicated text has been removed</li>
  <li class="sourceChange">Indicated text has been edited</li>
  <li class="sourceAdd">Indicated text has been added</li>
  <li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Indicated text is the source of a copy</li>
</ul>
</p><br/>
