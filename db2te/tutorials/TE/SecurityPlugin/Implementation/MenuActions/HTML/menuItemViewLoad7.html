<h3>Defining the Follow-on Action</h3><hr/>
<p>After the action is completed, we need to check the return value, as usual.  If the action returns 'false,' we'll have an error message pop up.
</p>

<p>Only if the action returns 'true,' will the page load.  But wait!  We're not done, and your menu won't work just yet.
</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
  <li><b>Don't forget the closing if</b> tag at the end of the page!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>You may remember that we used the 'followonAction' tag in part 5 of this tutorial.  The 'if' tag does exactly the same thing.  You can choose which one is more intuitive for you.
