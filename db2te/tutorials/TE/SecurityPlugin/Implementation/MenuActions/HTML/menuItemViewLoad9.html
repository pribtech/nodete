<h3>Adding Follow-On Actions</h3><hr/>
<p>The post-action conditions are almost the same as the first.  The difference is highlighted in yellow.
</p>
<p>If our second action returns 'false', an error message will pop up, and the page will not load.  
</p>

<p>If it returns 'true,' then we need the page to load.  The 'loadPage' tag does exactly that.</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
  <li><b>Don't forget the closing loadPage, task, and if</b> tags at the end of the page!</li>
</ol>
