<h3>Checking For an Object Using SQL Queries</h3><hr/>
<p>The second check is to verify the existence of the 'DB2AUTH.USERS' table.  It's actually very similar to the first check that we did.  The differences are highlighted in yellow on the right.
</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
  <li><b>Don't forget the closing action and task</b> tags at the end of the page!</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br/>
<p>We give our new action (not actionScript this time) a new name.  Then, we define our new parameters:
<ul>
  <li>This time our action is to check for an object (a table), so the value is set to 'checkForObject'</li>
  <li>We want to look for a table, so the object type is 'table'</li>
  <li>The table's schema is 'DB2AUTH'</li>
  <li>The table name is 'USERS'</li>
</ul>
