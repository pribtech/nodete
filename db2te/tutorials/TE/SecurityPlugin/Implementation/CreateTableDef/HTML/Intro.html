<p>Next, you will be taken through the creation of the db2auth security plugin control module.</p>
<p>If you have never worked or modified a table definition within the Technology Explorer you should first start with the first tutorial of the TE Workshop: 1. Customizing the TE.  It will give you an overview of how you can customize the Technology Explorer.</p>
<p>In order to take full advantage of this module creation tutorial, it is strongly recommended that you install the db2auth plug-in first.
Part 2 and 3 of this workshop will take you through the steps necessary for installation.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the plug-in, connect to the database where the authorization information is installed, using the db2auth administrator account.
