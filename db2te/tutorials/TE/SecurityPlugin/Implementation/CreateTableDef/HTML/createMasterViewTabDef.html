<H3>Create a Customized 'Master View' Table Definition from an SQL Query</H3><hr>
<p>With the query in the top right panel we are going to generate a base table definition to expand upon later in this lab.</p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Run the query. You should see a result set appear after the query has been run.
    </li>
    <li>View the table definition XML for this query by clicking on 'Generate table definition XML' in the upper right corner of the result set. This will open a new tab to the right of this text in which the XML will be displayed
    </li>
    <li>Save the table definition XML.  On Firefox, this would be by right-clicking in the XML document and then selecting 'This Frame' -> 'Save Frame As...'
    </li>
    <li>Save the file as 'db2authCustomMasterView.xml' in the folder '[your_TE_folder]/tableDefinitions/db2authLab'
    </li>
</ol></p>
