<H3>Create a Customized 'Users' Table Definition from an SQL Query</H3><hr>
<p>One of the original philosophies of this project is to gather and manipulate data from a database, without having to touch the underlying database. With the query in the top right panel we are going to generate a base table definition to expand upon later in this lab.</p>


<p><h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create the folder 'db2authLab' in the '[your_TE_folder]/tableDefinitions' folder</li>
	<li>Run the query. You should see a result set appear after the query has been run.
	</li>
	<li>View the table definition XML for this query by clicking on 'Generate table definition XML' in the upper right corner of the result set. This will open a new tab to the right of this text in which the XML will be displayed
	</li>
	<li>Save the table definition XML.  On Firefox, this would be by right-clicking in the XML document and then selecting 'This Frame' -> 'Save Frame As...'
	</li>
	<li>Save the file as 'db2authCustomUsers.xml' in the folder '[your_TE_folder]/tableDefinitions/db2authLab'
	</li>
</ol></p>
