<H3>Loading the Module</H3><hr>
<p>The db2auth plug-in offers a command-line interface to control authentication data.  The db2auth plug-in control module in the TE allows the same control with a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>When you try to load the module, it will verify that the db2auth plug-in is installed in the system by checking that there are 7 stored procedures created by the plug-in under the DB2AUTH schema. 
It will then check that one of those procedures is called ADD_USER.
Once this is verified, it will check for the existence of the DB2AUTH.USERS table.  
Upon failure of either one of these confirmations, the TE will alert the user, and nothing will load.
</p>
<p>If both the plug-in's procedures' and tables' existences are verified, the TE will load a new page that is split vertically.  
The top panel will contain four tabs as shown on the right: <b>Users</b>, <b>Groups</b>, <b>Group Memberships</b>, and <b>Master View</b>.  
The bottom panel will be the <b>details</b> panel, which will be discussed later.
