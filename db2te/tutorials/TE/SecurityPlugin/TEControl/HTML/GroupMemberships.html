<H3>The Group Memberships Tab</H3><hr>
<p>The Group Memberships tab displays all membership information.  The query for this tab display is displayed in the 'Ad hoc SQL' tab to the right.</p>
<p>The 'Group Memberships' tab next to the 'Ad hoc SQL' tab is the actual Group Memberships tab that the module pulls up.  If the tab has not loaded properly, you have not installed the plug-in, are not connected to the proper database, or do not have the proper privileges.  
In that case, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/other/GroupMembershipsTab.php?BASE_DIR=?BASE_DIRECTORY?');">click here for a sample view.</a></p>
<p>There are <b>four menu options</b> (two under the Edit Membership menu): 
<ul><li>Add User</li><li>Add Group</li><li>Edit Membership → Add User to Group</li><li>Edit Membership → Delete User from Group</li></ul></p>
<p>You will also see <b>three action icons:</b>
<ul><li><img src="images/trash.gif"/>&nbsp; to remove the membership</li>
<li><img src="images/icon-user.gif"/>&nbsp; to display more authorization details about the user (such as privileges and roles) in the bottom details panel (see page 7 of this tutorial for a picture)<br/>
</li><li><img src="images/group.gif"/>&nbsp; to display more authorization details about the group</li></ul><br/>
</p>
<H2>Steps:</H2><p>
<ol><li>
Click on the 'Group Memberships' tab located to the right of the 'Ad hoc SQL' tab

<p>Note: If a user does not belong to any group, the group column for that user will appear as "null."  Similarly, if a group has no users, the user column for that row will be "null."
