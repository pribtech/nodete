<H3>The Details Panel</H3><hr>
<p>As mentioned previously, clicking on the person icon will display authorization details about either the user or the group.
This information is displayed in what we call the bottom "details" panel.
</p>
<p>The 'Master View' tab next to the 'Ad hoc SQL' tab is the actual Master View tab that the module pulls up.  Try clicking on a person icon or group icon to view the details in the bottom panel.  If the tab has not loaded properly, you have not installed the plug-in, are not connected to the proper database, or do not have the proper privileges.  
In that case, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/other/DetailsTab.php?BASE_DIR=?BASE_DIRECTORY?');">click here for a sample details panel view.</a>
</p>
<p>
It should be noted however, that nothing will load in the details panel if the selected user ID or group ID does not exist in the AUTHID field in the SYSIBMADM.AUTHORIZATIONS table.
When a user ID or group ID exists in the AUTHID field, it means that the user or group has been given direct authorizations or privileges.
