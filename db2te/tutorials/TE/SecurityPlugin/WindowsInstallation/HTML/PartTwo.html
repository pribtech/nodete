<H3>Configure the db2auth_key.txt</H3><hr>
<p>This is the file that the plug-in gathers information about where to get the authorization data from.
It also gets group name to set SYSADM to, as well as the user name (and password in some cases) of the administrator.
</p>
<H2>Steps:</H2><p>
<ol><li>Open the db2auth_key.txt file.  
You should see a default configuration line: 
<ul>db2auth db2admns db2admin</ul>
<br/>This configuration follows the format: 
<br/>[name of db to store authorization info] [SYSADM admin group name] [admin user ID] ([admin password])
</li><br/>
<li>Replace this line with names of your choice.  The admin user ID should be the name with the necessary authorization, as verified in the previous step.
<ul><br/><li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Fill the password parameter <b>only if</b> the database where the authorization information is stored is <b>not local to the instance</b> that you are configuring the plug-in for.
</li></ul></li></ol></p>
