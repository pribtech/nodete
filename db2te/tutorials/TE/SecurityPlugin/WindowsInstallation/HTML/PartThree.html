<H3>Preparing the Database</H3><hr>
<p>Now we need to configure the database so that the plug-in can work with it.  This requires coping some files from the plug-in's folder to the necessary SQLLIB locations.  
<br/>We also need to create the schema, tables, and stored procedures necessary to run the plug-in.</p>

<H2>Steps:</H2><p>
<ol><li>Open a DB2 Command Window from the Start Programs menu, or open a command window and type <i>db2cmd</i>.
</li><br/>
<li>If DB2 has not been started yet, do so with the command, <i>db2start</i>.  Alternatively, you can also start DB2 from the control center.
</li><br/>
<li>If you have not yet created a database with the name that you specified in the db2auth_key.txt file, you can easily create one and issue it the name of your choice with the command:
<br/><i>db2 create db (your database name here)</i>
</li><br/>
<li>Connect to the authentication database: 
<br/><i>db2 connect to (your database name here)</i>
</li><br/>
<li>Next, type the command: 
<br/><i>db2auth_preparedb.bat > out.txt 2 > &1</i>
<br/>
<br/>This will run the batch script that prepares the DB2 database for plug-in use.  
It copies some plug-in files to the necessary SQLLIB locations.  It also creates a schema called DB2AUTH, tables (USERS, GROUPS, GROUP_MEMBERSHIPS), and stored procedures.
</li><br/><li>Check the file, out.txt, to verify that the process completed successfully.
</li><br/><li>Keep the DB2 Command Window open</li></ol></p><br/>
