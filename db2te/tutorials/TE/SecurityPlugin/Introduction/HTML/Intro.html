<H3>What Does the Db2auth Plug-in Do?</H3><hr>
DB2 is designed to separate authentication from authorization, and relies on a third party authentication mechanism.
This could pose as an inconvenience when migrating from other databases such as MySQL, which stores authentication information within the database.
The db2auth plug-in, written by Gene Kligerman, allows for authentication to DB2 without such external sources, by providing the means to store the information directly in the database.
It also allows for external modules, such as the Technology Explorer, to control users, groups and memberships.

<p>It should be noted however, that this limits the security initially provided by DB2.
Users of this plug-in should consider the degree of security their database needs prior to installing the plug-in, or should only use this as a temporary migration step from other database software.
