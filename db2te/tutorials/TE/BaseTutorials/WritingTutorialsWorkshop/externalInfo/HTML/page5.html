
<p><h3> Goal: </h3>
Create a <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('?BASE_DIRECTORY?/other/ImageFP.php?BASE_DIR=?BASE_DIRECTORY?&IMAGE_NAME=page5_cap.png');">link to another tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p><h3> Steps to complete: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Open <i>page1_1.html</i> with a text editor </li>
  <li> Append the text from the tab on the right onto the end of the file </li>
  <li> Save <i>page1_1.html</i> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3> Notes:</h3> 
For your own use you will have to change the value of "CurrentMenuLocation" and "tutorialName".  "CurrentMenuLocation" is the URL as an absolute path from the root of the TE including the tutorial directory and "tuturialName" is the name of the tutorial as defined in the <i>tutorialScript.xml</i> file.
