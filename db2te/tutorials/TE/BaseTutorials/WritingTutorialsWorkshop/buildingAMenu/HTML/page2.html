<p><h3> Goal: </h3>
Create a menu folder for your tutorials.
</p>

<p><h3> Steps to complete: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Create a new folder in <i>TE/tutorials</i> called 'myTutorials' </li>
    <li> Create a new file, <i>menu_04_myTutorials.xml</i> </li>
    <li> Open <i>menu_04_myTutorials.xml</i> with a text editor </li>
    <li> Make the changes as outlined in the file to the right by following these steps: (Refer to the legend below)
      <ul>
        <li> Set the menu type to "branch"</li>
        <li> Set the branchDirectory to "myTutorials" </li>
        <li> Set the description to "My Tutorials" </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p></p>
<p> <h3> Notes: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> The type 'branch' is used to designate menu directories and 'leaf' types are used to designate tutorials </li>
    <li> Menus are generated using any xml files starting with menu and ending in an xml extension within the directory.  The menu is sorted alphabetically using these xml files. </li>
    <li> Only menus that contain actual tutorials will be added to the 'Learn' menu so you will not be able to see the new menu item yet. </li>
  </ul>
