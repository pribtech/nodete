<p>Now that the Dependencies page is working, it would be great to be able to find out more about the dependent objects.
Many of the pages in the Technology Explorer include references to related tables. 
For example, the Columns pages, the Indexes page, and the Table Privileges page all include a reference link to the Table page to display the table relates to the column, index or privilege.
You can copy one of these references or type them in by hand.</p>
