<p>On the right, the table view has been reloaded. You should not see anything different from the last page. 
(Nothing changes since we are just pointing to a copy of the automatically generated profile that was used before.)</p>

<p><h3>Goal:</h3>
Check that your change to the Dependencies page is working correctly.
</p>
<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
If you see the updated Table page, look for the 'Dependencies' reference. 
It should now be using the XML table definition file 'tableDependCat.xml'. 
You can check this by selecting the dependencies icon for either 'DEMOADM.EMP' or 'DEMOADM.DEPT'. 
The dependencies for that table should be loaded into the lower panel. 
If nothing appears, go back to the tablecat.xml document and ensure you have correctly entered the proper table name specified in the previous step.
</p>
<p><h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
You may need to right click on the browser and reload TE.  If you see a blank page to the right it is possible that you have made an error with your editing. 
Open a new tab in the browser and load the table definition file (http://localhost/tableDefinitions/tablecat.xml). 
If there is an XML parsing error, Firefox should highlight the problem for you.
