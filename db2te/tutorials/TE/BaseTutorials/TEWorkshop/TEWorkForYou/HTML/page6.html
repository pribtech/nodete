<p><h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
You may need to right click on the browser, and reload TE.
If you see a blank page to the right, it is possible that you have made an error with your editing. 
Open a new tab in the browser and navigate to the table definition file (http://localhost/tableDefinitions/tablecat.xml). 
If there is an XML parsing error Firefox should highlight the problem for you. 
Otherwise, go back and review your changes.
