<p>On the right, the table view should have reloaded. 
From the edits that you made in the previous step, you should see two new columns in the Dependencies page.
Select an icon in the Dependencies column to see the change.
</p>
<p><h3>Goal:</h3>
Check the modified columns in the Dependencies page.
</p>
<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
If you see the updated Dependencies page, look for the new icons beside the depending and dependent tables. 
You can check this by selecting the dependencies icon for either 'DEMOADM.EMP' or 'DEMOADM.DEPT'. 
The dependencies for that table should be loaded into the lower panel. 
Confirm all your changes from the last step.
</p>
<p><h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
You may need to right click on the browser and reload TE.  If you see a blank page to the right, it is possible that you have made an error with your editing. 
Open a new tab in the browser and load the table definition file (http://localhost/tableDefinitions/tablecat.xml). 
If there is an XML parsing error, Firefox should highlight the problem for you. 
</p>

<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
<p>If you want to continue improving the Dependencies page you may consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Removing the owner type column since its value is always 'user'.
		<li>Creating a reference link to the definer and owner
		<li>Added text to the description tag in the XML profile. Example are easy to find in other XML profiles.
	</ul>
<p>Now that you have mastered the basics of customizing the Technology Explorer you can try extending it in the second tutorial, Extending the TE. 
You will build menus, create new pages from complex queries, build forms, and construct actions.</p>
