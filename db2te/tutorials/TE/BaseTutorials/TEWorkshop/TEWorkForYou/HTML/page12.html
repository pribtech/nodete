<p>On the right the table view should have reloaded. 
From the simple edits that you made in the previous step, you will see a significant improvement in the display of the dependency information.
Select an icon in the Dependencies column to see the change.
</p>
<p><h3>Goal:</h3>
Check the modified columns in the Dependencies page.
</p>
<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
If you see the updated Table page, look for the 'Dependencies' reference. 
You can check this by selecting the dependencies icon for either 'DEMOADM.EMP' or 'DEMOADM.DEPT'. 
The dependencies for that table should be loaded into the lower panel. 
Confirm all your changes from the last step.

<p><h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
You may need to right click on the browser and reload TE.  If you see a blank page to the right, it is possible that you have made an error with your editing. 
Open a new tab in the browser and load the table definition file (http://localhost/tableDefinitions/tablecat.xml). 
If there is an XML parsing error, Firefox should highlight the problem for you.
