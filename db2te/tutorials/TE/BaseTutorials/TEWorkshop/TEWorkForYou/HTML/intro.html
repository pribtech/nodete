<p>This tutorial demonstrates how you can customize the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 (TE). 
There are probably numerous queries you run on a regular basis and tables that you explore either 
from the command line or the Control Center. In this lab you will quickly extend an existing Technology Explorer page to explore table dependencies. 
</p>
<p>
Views and materialized query tables (MQTs) depend on the existence and privileges of other objects.
If you drop or alter one of those objects it can affect the state of the views or MQTs that depend on them. 
</p>
<p>	
Table dependencies can be found in the system catalog table 'SYSCAT.TABDEP'.
Each row represents a dependency of a view or a materialized query table on some other object. 
The view or materialized query table depends on the object of type 'BTYPE' of name 'BNAME', 
so a change to the object affects the view or materialized query table.
