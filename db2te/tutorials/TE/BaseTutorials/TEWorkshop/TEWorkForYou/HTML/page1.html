<p>To determine the dependencies for a table, you may use a query similar to the one on the right. 
It selects all the views or MQTs dependent on a given table, in this case 'DEMOADM.DEPT'. 
If you use SQL to answer questions like this on a regular basis, you may also:
<ul>
	<li>Have to look up the catalog table each time you need it</li>
	<li>Have a common script you modify when you need this information</li>
	<li>Use it so often that you have the query memorized</li>
	<li>Been ambitious enough to write a script to retrieve the information</li>
	<li>Used a tool such as the Control Center or Data Studio</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Without some kind of tool you have to remember where the data is stored, what columns you want to look at, and the table and schema you need to look up. 
</p>
<p><h3>Goal:</h3>
Explore the SQL used to retrieve table dependencies.
</p>
<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Run the query on the right by pressing the 'Run' button. 
The results appear in the Statement result tab in the lower window.
Information about the statement appears in the Console tab.</li>
<li>Explore the options in the Ad Hoc query window. Try your own statements. 
The Ad Hoc is part of the Technology Explorer.
</ul>
