<p>From this point on in the lab, you will be editing the table definition file '/var/www/tableDefinitions/ATSLab/atsBaseView.xml' which you saved earlier in page 6 of the '1. Introduction' step of this lab. The name 'table definition' no longer appropriately describes what these files are capable of. They are much more powerful than simply providing a framework to display a table or view. Within the table definition file, you can define countless actions which can be performed on either an entire dataset, or on a row-by-row basis. </p>

<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open the file 'atsBaseView.xml' which you saved earlier; a graphical editor will probably work best for this lab. You will be working with the file for the rest of the lab so keep it open.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the lab, the table definition will be transformed from it's raw state to what is available in the menu today. This will be done by:
<ul>
  <li>Editing the table definition file to contain better descriptions of the table and columns within</li>
  <li>Writing an action to open up a detailed view from the two base tables</li>
  <li>Writing an action to delete an administrative task</li>
  <li>Writing an action to edit an administrative task</li>
  <li>Creating a menu and writing an action to create new administrative tasks</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Remember you can view your work anytime by reloading or navigating to the menu item we created earlier in the lab. </p>

<p>If you do not wish to edit the file by hand, you can copy the XML text displayed to the left at almost any time, and overwrite the file. There are some pages where there are lines marked to be deleted; and as such, you will need to manually remove them if you are coping the text. On these pages there will be a note of this at the top of the information in this panel.</p>

<p>On to the edits...</p>
