<p><b>You're done!</b> Really, you just wrote an action to add a new administrative task. Go check it out and enjoy your work because you're done the lab as well.</p>

<p>I hope you learned something useful and have enjoyed the lab. See you next year and check out sf.net/projects/db2mc for the latest version and updates. </p>

<p>Over the next few months the newly named Technology Explorer team will be stabilizing and updating any legacy components of the old Monitoring Console. </p>

<p>The team is also going to aim to add new tutorials every week until we either run out of content or are given more pressing things to do.  </p>

<p>We look forward to your feedback and participation in the project.</p>
