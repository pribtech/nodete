<p>The action type to display and populate a form is 'form'. </p>

<p>Forms can either get their data from a raw data source or a server action on the server. If a parameter of name 'message' is set, the value contained within will be placed on the form panel. Otherwise a HTML server action will be called and the return data will be placed on the form panel. For this form action, the data is going to be acquired from the HTML server action 'getHeadlessTableForm' which will generate a form from the table definition file 'AdminTask/atsTaskEdit'(.xml) that was generated and modified from the db2 stored procedure SYSPROC.ADMIN_TASK_UPDATE.</p>

<p>One key feature of forms is that their return data is automatically inserted into shared parameters. This will allow for easy preservation or retrieval of the entered data if either an error occurs or the data is required to be accessed later in the script. </p>
