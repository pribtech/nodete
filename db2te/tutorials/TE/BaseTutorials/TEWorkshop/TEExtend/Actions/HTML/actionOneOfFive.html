<p>Pages can be loaded from within an action using the task 'loadPage'. Inside of the 'loadPage' task, a menu item is expected to be defined. </p>

<p>The contents of the 'loadPage' task should look familiar from the menu element we created earlier.</p>

<p><h2>Items of interest:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the element 'link': <ul>
		<li>the attribute 'window' is set to '_self', indicating we want to open the link in this window</li>
		<li>the attribute 'target' is set to 'adminTaskDetail' and 'adminStatusDetail' which are the two lower panels we defined earlier in the menu item</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The string '?TASKID?' represents a parameter marker. This string will be replaced with the value contained in a parameter of the name TASKID, and if no parameter is found, the parameter marker will remain unchanged.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Keep in mind when you are writing links that if the target does not exist in the targeted window, the window will be reset to contain only the panel of the target name. </b></p>

<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make the changes to your document as indicated on the right</li>
  <li>Check your work, then reload the panel containing the Task Scheduler or open it again from your menu item</li>
</ul>
</p>
