<p>Your main device to create a complex layout is a 'splitPanel'. A split panel takes a container and splits it into 2 containers. This split can be 'v' vertical or 'h' horizontal, specified in the 'direction' attribute. There are a number of other options available within a split panel. <!--See here for more information.--> For most information displays, a top main panel is used for the content and then lower split panel is used to show details or actions from the top panel.</p>

<p>Example of a spit panel in action:</p>

<p>If you look at this tutorial layout, a split panel has been used to split the main window into 2 components; the left content panel, this panel, and the right stage, where the highlighted code is. By default a split panel is set at a ratio of 1/3 of the space to the left or bottom container and 2/3 for the right or top container.</p>
