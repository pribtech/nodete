<p>For this module there are two detail views to accommodate the base view for the Administrative Task Scheduler. Another vertical split panel is used in the bottom pane. A new attribute has also been used, 'splitPercent', this allows you to override the default 1/3 to 2/3 split. The number represents the amount of space the left or bottom panel will have. The number must be greater than 0 and less than 1.</p>
