<p>Menus represent the most basic way a user can access information from within the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2. The main menu you see at the top of this screen is generated from a series of XML files located within the menu folder of the root folder of the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2. Menus can also be embedded into table definition files which will be covered later in the lab.</p>

<p><h4>The changes to the file will not be explicitly laid out in the text as they are noted in the right panel:</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="sourceRemove">Indicated text has been removed</li>
  <li class="sourceChange">Indicated text has been edited</li>
  <li class="sourceAdd">Indicated text has been added</li>
  <li class="sourceCopiedFrom">Indicated text is the source of a copy</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create the file 'menu_20_ATSLabFolder.xml' in the directory /var/www/menu/ by:
  <ul>
		<li>Opening a terminal</li>
		<li>Running the following command:
			<ul>
				<li>'sudo gedit /var/www/menu/menu_20_ATSLabFolder.xml &'</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Copy or enter the text from the right into the file</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!--
<p>For a complete overview of menus and their XML structure see here.</p>

<p>All menu files must start with 'menu_' and end in an '.xml' extension, all other files in the directory will be ignored by the menu parser. </p>

<p> <h4> More Information:</h4>

This menu item is of type 'branch' indicating that the menu will contain either a 'branchDirectory' or a 'rootDirectory' where other XML menu files can be located. A branch directory expects the given folder name to be located under the current folder. A root directory expects the given folder name to be located from the root path of the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2. The attribute 'delayLoad' tells the program that it should not immediately render the sub-directory, but that the web browser should call back for it. Lastly, the description element contains the descriptive text that is to be displayed when rendering the menu item.</p>
