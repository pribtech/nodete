<p>The stored procedures that are used with the Administration Task Scheduler allow you to update, delete, and add new tasks. For this lab, XML table definitions of the 'ADMIN_TASK_ADD' and 'ADMIN_TASK_UPDATE' procedures are required to generate data entry forms. If you were building this module, you would save the automatically generated  XML table definition from the 'ADMIN_TASK_UPDATE' and 'ADMIN_TASK_ADD' procedures on the right, and edit them.</p>

<p>Again for the lab, editing these files would be needless and repetitive column renaming and the separation of the datetime column into 2 individual columns. Alternatively, you could have the Technology Explorer generate the definition on the fly, but the column names would not be human friendly and it would be more difficult for a user to write a timestamp. Conveniently, the XML table definition has already been created for the Administrative Task Scheduler module, so it will be used.

<!--
<p>How to save an XML table definition of a procedure:
<ul>
<li>Click the XML icon on the row of the procedure you wish to generate an XML table definition for</li>
<li>Save the table definition by right-clicking in the XML document and selecting 'This Frame' -> 'Save Frame As...' </li>
</ul></p>
