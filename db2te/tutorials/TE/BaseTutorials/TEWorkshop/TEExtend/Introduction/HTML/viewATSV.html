<p>To the right, you will see the two base views for the administrative task scheduler. The top view contains information about the task itself while the bottom view contains information about the run status and history of each task. These two views will not be used directly for the main view because they contain all information of each task one would ever need to know. These views will be used when someone wants full information about a task. If you were building this module, you would save the automatically generated  XML table definition from the two views on the right and edit them.</p>

<p>For the lab, editing these files would be needless and repetitive column renaming. Alternatively, you could have the Technology Explorer generate the definition on the fly, but the column names would not be human friendly. Conveniently, the XML table definition has already been created for the administrative task scheduler module, so it will be used. </p>

<p>How to save an XML table definition of a view:
<ul>
<li>View the table definition XML for this query by clicking on 'XML' in the upper right corner of the panel</li>
<li>Save the table definition by right-clicking in the XML document and selecting 'This Frame' -> 'Save Frame As...' </li>
</ul></p>
