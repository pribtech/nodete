<p>In this lab you will be taken through the creation of the DB2 LUW Administrative Task Scheduler (ATS) module located under the menu entry: <br/>
<ul><li>Tools â†’ Task Scheduler </li></ul></p>
<p>If you have never worked or modified table definition within the Technology Explorer you should first start with the first tutorial of this workshop: 1. Customizing the TE.  It will give you an overview of how you can customize the Technology Explorer.</p>
<p>The DB2 LUW Administrative Task Scheduler allows the DB2 server to perform administrative tasks at a predefined schedule, similar to a cron job on UNIX based systems. These tasks are performed against the database, independent of the Database Administration Server (DAS) functionality. Administrative tasks are limited to running only cataloged stored procedures.</p>
<p>In this lab you will:
<ul>
<li>Create a module from start to finish</li>
<li>Learn how to extend or modify an existing component of the Technology Explorer (TE) for IBM DB2</li>
<li>Have a basic guide to help you build other modules</li>
</ul>
</p>
