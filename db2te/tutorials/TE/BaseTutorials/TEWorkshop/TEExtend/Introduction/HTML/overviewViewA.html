<p>One of the original philosophies of this project is to gather and manipulate data from a database, without having to touch the underlying database. With the query in the top right panel we are going to generate a base table definition to expand upon later in this lab.</p>

<p><h3>Goal:</h3>
Generate a base table definition file from an SQL query.
</p>
<p><h3>Steps to complete:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create the folder 'ATSLab' in the '/var/www/tableDefinitions' folder by:
	<ul>
		<li>Opening a terminal</li>
		<li>Running the following command:
			<ul>
				<li>'sudo mkdir /var/www/tableDefinitions/ATSLab'</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Setting the file permissions with the following command:
			<ul>
				<li>'sudo chmod 755 /var/www/tableDefinitions/ATSLab'</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>Run the query. You should see a result set appear after the query has been run.
	</li>
	<li>View the table definition XML for this query by clicking on 'Generate table definition XML' in the upper right corner of the result set. This will open a new tab to the right of this text in which the XML will be displayed
	</li>
	<li>Save the table definition by right-clicking in the XML document and then selecting 'This Frame' -> 'Save Frame As...'
	</li>
	<li>Save the file as 'atsBaseView.xml' in the folder '/var/www/tableDefinitions/ATSLab'
	</li>
</ul></p>
