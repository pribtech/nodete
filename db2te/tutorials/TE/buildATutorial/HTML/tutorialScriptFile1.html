<p>To the right you will see the basic tutorial XML structure. The base tutorial element has an attribute name this name is used to display the name of the tutorial in the title bar and with in the windows tab. For the current tutorial the name was set to 'Building a tutorial'. </p>

<p>Next is the element 'globalCodeHighlightOptions' with the attribute of 'highlightCode' set to true. This will cause the code placed into the ad hoc window to initially have syntax highlighting. Though the user will lose this highlighting if they chose to edit the code, like the XML code to the right the color coding does make things easier to read.</p>

<p>Last we have the 'pageList' element. This element will contain a series of 'page' elements that will map to the individual pages of our tutorial. </p>

<p>Steps to complete:
<ul>
<li>Create a file called 'tutorialScript.xml' in the folder './tutorials/tableJoins'</li>
<li>Copy the contents of tab 'tutorialScript.xml' located to the right into the new created file</li>
<li>Save the file, but do not close it</li>
</ul></p>
