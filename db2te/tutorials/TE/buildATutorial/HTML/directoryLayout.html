<p>Each tutorial with in the Technology Explorer is isolated in its own directory within the tutorial folder of the Technology Explorer.</p>

<p>For the 'Table joins' tutorial that will be build you will need to create the directory 'tableJoins' under the tutorial folder './tutorials/'.</p>

<p>Under the 'tableJoins' directory three other folders are required
<ul>
<li>actionScripts <ul><li>this directory is used to store all action scripts used by the action panels, This directory only needs to be present if you are going to use action panels.</li></ul></li>
<li>HTML <ul><li>this directory contains HTML tutorial content. (The page rendered in this panel are stored here), this directory is required</li></ul></li>
<li>SQL <ul><li>this directory contains any SQL scripts that are loaded by the Ad Hoc for the tutorial., this directory is required </li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You my have as many other directories as you need under the main path for other files that you need for the tutorial. Often this directory will just be called 'other'. </p>
