Then the 'echo' task is used to identify to the user what the current running statement is. Now the action named 'statmentTimer' is called using the 'callAction' task. Lastly the avgRunTime is save from the action script into a global parameter for later use and then echo the results using the 'echo' task.</p>

<ul><li>Copy the contents of tab 'joinTiming.xml' located to the right into the file 'joinTiming.xml'.
</li><li>Save the file, but do not close it
</li><li>Reload the 'About table joins' tutorial navigate to the last page. An action panel with one button should now be displayed on the right hand side. You can run this action to test your work.
