<p>As this tutorial is on table joins lets pull in this information from the IBM's DB2 information center. To do this a 'pageWindow' menu element is used. There are a few things different about this menu from the one that was used earlier. Fist there is no primary panel set so the 'title' element has been used within the 'pageWindow' element to set a tab title. Next within the panel in place of the 'link' element the 'URL' element has been used and it contains a HTML URL which will be loaded in an iframe embedded within the panel.</p>

<p>Impotent note: When importing links from the information center if you do not wish the entire information center to load but just the page you are interested loaded,  add the following '?noframes=true' to the end of the URL.</p>
<p>
Steps to complete:
<ul>
<li>Copy the contents of tab 'tutorialScript.xml' located to the right into the file 'tutorialScript.xml'.
</li><li>Save the file, but do not close it
</li><li>Reload the 'About table joins' tutorial you should now see your introductory page and if you are connected to the internet you should see an information center panel loaded into right hand stage.
</li></ul>
