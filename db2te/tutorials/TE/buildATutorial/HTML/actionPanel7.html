<p>To understand how graphs work and the available graph option it is recommend to review out the graphing workshop as in depth graph option will not be covered here.</p>

<p>Read more about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) here.</p>

<p>Within the 'loadPage' element of the task's action a menu item to load a graph object has been created. At this time graphs use a JSON object to pass instruction to the graphYUI to render the graph. The datasets contain the required base data to render the graph. </p>

<p>To insert each of the four runs substitution parameters are used and there values are multiplied by 1000 to convert them to ms (At this time the YUI graphing package does not like small numbers <0.1).</p>

<p>Steps to complete:

<ul><li>Copy the contents of tab 'joinTiming.xml' located to the right into the file 'joinTiming.xml'.
</li><li>Save & Close the file
</li><li>Reload the 'About table joins' tutorial navigate to the last page. An action panel with one button should now be displayed on the right hand side. You can run both action to test your work.
</li></ul>
