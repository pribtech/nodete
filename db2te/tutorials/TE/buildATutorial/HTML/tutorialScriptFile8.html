<p>Some times you will need to demonstrate concepts that require multiple action at once or are more complicated then running a series of SQL statements. </p>

<p>To accomplish these more complex demonstration the action panel component is used. Action panels load and allow a user to run a series of action scripts. These scripts are all contained in an action panel XML file located in the actionScript folder of the tutorial. An action panel is loaded using the tag 'loadActionScriptFile' within the page element of the tutorial script.</p>

<p>For this page an action panel to demonstrate the performance difference between each of the table join type is going to be created. </p>

<p>Steps to complete:

<ul><li>Create a file called 'joinTiming.html' in the folder './tutorials/tableJoins/HTML'
</li><li>Copy the contents of tab 'joinTiming.html' located to the right into the new created file.
</li><li>Save & close the file
</li><li>Copy the contents of tab 'tutorialScript.xml' located to the right into the file 'tutorialScript.xml'.
</li><li>Save & Close the file
</li></ul>
