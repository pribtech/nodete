<p>This workshop series is designed to help get you started building tutorials for the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2. As with the Technology Explorer it self this workshop is constantly evolving. If a topic is not cover in this series please let us know.</p>

<p>This particular tutorial is intended to help you get an overview on how to build tutorials within the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2.</p>

<p>The tutorial will take you though building a simple language example of how to use table joins with in DB2 and then how to do a performance comparison of the different types of joins to demonstrate the basic use of an action panel and graph components.   </p>

<p>Step by step instruction for the building of a tutorial are provided. This is contrary to how most tutorials are build, normally you will starts by finding an existing tutorial of similar structure and using it as a base to build the desired tutorial. With this in mind, this tutorial will not cover any topic in depth but strive to provide the base knowledge you will require to begin building tutorials on your own. </p>

<p>For more in depth knowledge of how to use/build other components see the complimentary tutorials available in this workshop.</p>
