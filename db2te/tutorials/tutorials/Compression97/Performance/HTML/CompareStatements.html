<p>Run the four statements in the Ad Hoc command window to the right and review the runtimes in the console window.</p>
<p>The first two statements compare a select statement with an 'order by' clause. 
Including the 'order by' ensures that each row in the table is loaded into memory for sorting
and that each row is uncompressed. 
Even in this case you will usually see that the compressed table runs faster than the uncompressed.</p>
<p>The second set of two statements compare a COUNT(*).
While the COUNT(*) touches every row in the table it does not require them to be decompressed.
It also doesn't require the in-memory sort that comes with the 'order by'.
You should see that the COUNT(*) is dramatically faster with compression.</p>
