<p>So why are times often better for compressed tables? This step performs a deeper analysis of both CPU and IO performance.
<p>Select the actions on this page in order.</p>
<h4>Run performance tests</h4>
The first step runs a select with an 'order by' clause against a compressed and uncompressed table. 
<pre><code>
SELECT * 
   FROM customer_address_without_compression 
   ORDER BY customer_id;

SELECT * 
   FROM customer_address_with_compression 
   ORDER BY customer_id;
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<h4>Graph the results</h4>
<p>You can then graph the results for runtime, IO and CPU performance</p>
<p>If you hover your cursor over the bars in the graph you will see the precise results for each table.</p>
