<p>This step compares automatic table compression to manual table compression.</p>
<h4>Get actual compressed size</h4>
The first step collects statistics for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION table and retrieves an estimate of the the table size.
The SQL used to collect statistics and determine the table size are:
<p><pre><code>
CALL ADMIN_CMD
  ('RUNSTATS ON TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION')

SELECT CAST(CAST(NPAGES AS DOUBLE)/256
  AS DECIMAL(5,3))
  FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
    WHERE CREATOR=?SCHEMA?
      AND NAME='CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION'

</code></pre></p>
<h4>Compare table sizes</h4>
<p>The second step plots the current table size, the estimated table size,
the actual compressed size, and the automatically compressed size on a bar graph.</p>
<p>
	Since we don't compress the first one to two MB of data inserted into the table it does not compress as much as a full
	reorganization would compress the data.
	This is a small table, so one to two megabytes has a significant impact on the overall compression of this table.
	If the table was gigabytes in size, not compressing the first couple of megabytes is negligable.
