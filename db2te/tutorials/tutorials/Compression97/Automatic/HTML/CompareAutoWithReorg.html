<p>This step compares the different variations of table compression.</p>
<h4>Get compressed size after reorganization</h4>
The first step collects statistics for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION table and retrieves an estimate of the the table size.
The SQL used to collect statistics and determine the table size are:
<p><pre><code>
CALL ADMIN_CMD
  ('RUNSTATS ON TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION')

SELECT CAST(CAST(NPAGES AS DOUBLE)/256
  AS DECIMAL(5,3))
  FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
    WHERE CREATOR=?SCHEMA?
      AND NAME='CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION'

</code></pre></p>
<h4>Compare table sizes</h4>
<p>The second step plots the previous table sizes against the automatically compressed table after it is reorganized.</p>
<p>If you hover your cursor over the bars in the graph you will see the exact sizes of each table.
Notice how much space the reorganization step reclaimed from the first few megabytes.</p>
<h4>Rebuilding your dictionary</h4>
<p>Also notice that it still isn't as low as the table that was reorganized after compression was turned on.
That is because a simple reorganization on an automatic table does not rebuild the compression dictionary.
To do that you need to use the RESETDICTIONARY command parameter on the REORG command to rebuild everything.</p>
<p>Try going back to the previous step, add RESETDICTIONARY to the REORG command, rerun the command and the return to this step to see the results.
You will need to rerun the actions on this page to update your results.</p>
<p><pre><code>
CALL ADMIN_CMD
  ('REORG TABLE ?SCHEMA?.CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_WITH_AUTO_COMPRESSION
  RESETDICTIONARY');
</code></pre></p>
