<p>Run the statement in the Ad Hoc command window to the right.</p>
<p>This step shows you how to fully compress an automatically compressed table.</p>
<p>As you saw in the previous step we don't compress the first one to two megabytes of data inserted into the table when using automatic compression
While these couple of megabytes are negligable for anything but small tables you can still compress them as well.</p>
<p>The reorganization statement uses the existing compression dictionary to compress the first few megabytes in the table.</p>
