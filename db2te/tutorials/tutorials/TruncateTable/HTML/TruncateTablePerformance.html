<p>
	Select the three actions on this page in order.
</p>
<p>
	This step will compare the performance differences between TRUNCATE and DELETE.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Run TRUNCATE time test</b><br />
	Truncate rows in the 1k, 5k, 10k, 50k and 100k tables and record the time required to perform each operation.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Graph TRUNCATE times</b><br />
	Plot the TRUNCATE performance data on the graph.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Compare DELETE vs. TRUNCATE times</b><br />
	Adds performance data from previous DELETE operations to the graph for comparison.
</p>
<p>
	After running the three actions you should see a graph in the lower right
	panel comparing the performance differences between the two commands.
	Note that TRUNCATE performs consistently even with larger data sets.
