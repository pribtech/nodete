The DECODE statement can almost do what the CASE statement does, but with a 
  simpler syntax. Note that the DECODE function can only check for equality, rather
  than ranges of values, similar to the prior CASE statement.
  <p>
  This example won't give exactly the same results as the example since the 
  function INT(SALARY/5000) will round up or down depending on the value computed.
