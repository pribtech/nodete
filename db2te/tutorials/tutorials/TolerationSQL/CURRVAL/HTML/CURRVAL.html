<H3>The CURRVAL and NEXTVAL functions</H3> <hr>
<p>
Instead of following the SQL Standard syntax to retrieve a sequence value, some vendors use pseudocolumns. That is: 
  <b>.NEXTVAL</b> and <b>.CURRVAL</b>
  
<p>This is equivalent to: 

  NEXT VALUE FOR  and PREVIOUS VALUE FOR 
  
In DB2, NEXT VALUE and PREVIOUS VALUE expressions get turned into generic built in functions.</p>
