The following SQL will display all of the different conversion formats
  that are available with the TO_CHAR function. A format-string must contain a 
  combination of the format elements listed below. Two format elements can 
  optionally be separated by one or more of the following separator characters:
  <ul>
  <li>dash (-)  </li>
  <li>period (.) </li>
  <li>slash (/)  </li>
  <li>comma (,)  </li>
  <li>apostrophe (') </li>
  <li>semi-colon (;)  </li>
  <li>colon (:)  </li>
  <li>blank ( )  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Separator characters can also be specified at the start or end of format-string. The
  available format elements are:
  <ul>
