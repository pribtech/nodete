<H3>The optional AS clause</H3><hr><p>
DB2 and the SQL Standard force naming of subqueries, but some databases do not require 
  it. For instance, the following example will work in DB2, but not in other database
  products:
  <pre>
SELECT * FROM T, (SELECT * FROM S) AS X 
SELECT * FROM T, TABLE(FOO()) AS X 
  </pre>
  <p>The correlation names can now be removed from DB2 queries and will continue
  to work:
  <pre>
SELECT * FROM T, (SELECT * FROM S)
SELECT * FROM T, TABLE(FOO())
  </pre>

  <p>
  Additionally, in the case of a table function reference,
  the function name is implied as the name of the derived table to allow reference of 
  columns returned by the function by function name.  The implicit name generated for a
  table function includes the schema name used to create the function.  
  Implicit names are resolved as if they were explicitly supplied.
