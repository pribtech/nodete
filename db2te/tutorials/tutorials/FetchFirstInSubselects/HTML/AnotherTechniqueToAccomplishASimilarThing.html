<p>
	Run the query in the right panel.
</p>
<p>
	Another way to solve this problem is to use the DISTINCT keyword in the select statement.
	This keyword makes sure that each value returned is unique, since there were two entries
	with the value one, it will only return one row with the value of one.
</p>
<p>
	If you run the query, you'll see the results are the same as the query in the previous step.
</p>
<p>
	Now you have seen how to use Fetch First syntax in a sub-select statement and that it
	has a keyword that can accomplish a similar function.
