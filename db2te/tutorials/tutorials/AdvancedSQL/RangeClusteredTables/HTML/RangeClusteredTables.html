DB2 UDB V8.1.4 implements a new table design called range-clustered tables.
<P>A range-clustered table (RCT) is a table layout scheme where each record in
the table has a predetermined offset from the logical start of the
table.
</P>
<P>For each table that holds your data, consider which of the possible table
types would best suit your needs. For example, if you have data records
that will be loosely clustered (not monotonically increasing), consider using
a regular table and indexes. If you have data records that will have
duplicate (not unique) values in the key, you should not use a range-clustered
table. If you cannot afford to preallocate a fixed amount of storage on
disk for the range-clustered tables you might want, you should not use this
type of table. These factors will help you to determine whether you
have data that can be used as a range-clustered table.
</P>
<P>An algorithm is used to equate the value of the key for the record with the
location of a specific row within a table. The basic algorithm is
fairly simple. In its most basic form (using a single column instead of
two or more columns to make up the key), the algorithm maps a sequence number
to a logical row number. The algorithm also uses the record's key
to determine the logical page number and slot number. This process
provides exceptionally fast access to records; that is, to specific rows
in the table. Using the key, the exact logical location of the record
on disk can be found using linear interpolation. The algorithm is more
complex when multiple columns are used to create the key.
</P>
<P>The algorithm does not involve hashing because hashing does not preserve
key-value ordering. Preserving key-value ordering is essential because
it eliminates the need to reorganize the table data over time.
</P>
<P>Each record key in the table should have the following
characteristics:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Unique
</LI>
<LI>Not null
</LI>
<LI>An integer (SMALLINT, INTEGER, or BIGINT)
</LI>
<LI>Monotonically increasing
</LI>
<LI>Within a predetermined set of ranges based on each column in the key 
<P>The ALLOW OVERFLOW option is used when creating the table to allow key
values to exceed the defined range. The DISALLOW OVERFLOW option is
used when creating the table where key values will not exceed the defined
range. In this case, if a record is inserted out of the boundary
indicated by the range, an SQL error message is returned. 
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Applications where tightly clustered (dense) sequence key ranges are likely
are excellent candidates for range-clustered tables. When using this
type of key to create a range-clustered table, the key is used to generate the
logical location of a row in a table. This process avoids the need for
a separate index.
