The two examples that follow are simple, and demonstrate the ways to create
  a <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/c0020090.html');">range-clustered table</a>. The examples show how you can use either 
  single or multiple columns as the key to the table. In
  addition, they show how to create a table that allows data to overflow, and a
  table that does not allow data to overflow.
  <P>The first example shows a range-clustered table that is used to locate a
  student using a STUDENT_ID. For each student record, we include the
  following information:
  </P>
  <UL>
  <LI>School ID </LI>
  <LI>Program ID </LI>
  <LI>Student number </LI>
  <LI>Student ID </LI>
  <LI>Student first name </LI>
  <LI>Student last name </LI>
  <LI>Student grade point average (GPA) </LI>
  </UL>
  <P>In this case, we would like to work with student records solely based on
  the STUDENT_ID. The STUDENT_ID will be used to add, update, and delete
  student records.</P>

<DD>Other indexes can be added separately at another time. However, for
  the purpose of this example, the organization of the table and how to access
  the table's data are defined when the table is created.
