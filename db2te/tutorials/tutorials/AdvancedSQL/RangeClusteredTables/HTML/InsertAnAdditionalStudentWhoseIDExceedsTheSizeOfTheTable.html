This SQL will attempt to <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000970.html');">INSERT</a> a student that is outside the range of the table. This will result
  in an error message since the table has not been defined to hold this much data. Note that you 
  cannot alter the table to accept more records. You must re-create the table at this point in time
  if you run out of "slots".
  <P>You control the behavior of a range-clustered table (RCT) that allows
  overflow records by using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000927.html');">CREATE TABLE</a> statement and the ALLOW OVERFLOW
  option. In this way, you ensure that all of the pages required by the
  table within the defined range are allocated immediately.
  </P>
  <P>Once created, any records with keys that fall into the defined range work
  the same way, regardless of whether the table is created with the overflow
  option allowed or disallowed. The difference occurs when there is a
  record with a key that falls outside of the defined range. In this
  case, when the table allows overflow records, the record is placed in the
  overflow area, which is dynamically allocated. As more records are
  added from outside the defined range, they are placed into the growing
  overflow area. Actions against the table that involve this overflow
  area will require longer processing time because the overflow area must be
  accessed as part of the action. The larger the overflow area, the
  longer it will take to access the overflow area. After prolonged use of
  the overflow area, consider reducing its size by exporting the data from the
  table to a new range-clustered table that you have defined using new, extended
  ranges.
  </P>
  <P>There might be times when you do not want records placed into a
  range-clustered table to have record key values falling outside of an allowed
  or defined range. For this type of RCT to exist, you must use the
  DISALLOW OVERFLOW option on the CREATE TABLE statement. Once you have
  created this type of RCT, you might have to accept error messages if a record
  key value falls outside of the allowed or defined range.
