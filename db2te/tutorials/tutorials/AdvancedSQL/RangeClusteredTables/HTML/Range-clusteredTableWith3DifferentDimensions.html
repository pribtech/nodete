In the second example, which is a variation on the first, consider the idea of a school board. 
  In the school board there are 5 schools, each having 10 classrooms with a capacity of 20 students.     This school board can accommodate a maximum of 5*10*20 = 1,000 students. 
  <p>
  In this case, we would like to work with student records based on three factors: 
  the SCHOOL_ID, the   CLASS_ID, and the STUDENT_NUM values. Each of these three columns 
  will have unique values and will   be used together to add, update, and delete student records.

  Note:
  As with the previous example, other indices may be added separately and at some other time.
