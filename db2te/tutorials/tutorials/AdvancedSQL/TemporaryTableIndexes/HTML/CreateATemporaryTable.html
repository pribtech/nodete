The next SQL statement will create a temporary table that is valid for this session only.
  The <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/t0020127.html');">DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</a>
   statement specifies the name of the temporary table (T1) and how it is defined.  In this
  example, the table is created based on the structure of another table (transactions).  This
  simplifies the creation of these tables since you do not need to know the structure of the table
  that you will extracting data from.
  <p>
  The clause "on commit preserve rows" means that if a commit statement is issued, the temporary table
  is kept "alive".  In this case, the table will only go away when you physically disconnect from 
  the system.  The "in db2demo" specifies the tablespace that will contain this temporary table.
  This tablespace must be defined beforehand in order for this SQL to work.
  </p>
  <p/>
  Now that we have defined this table, we can now insert data into it like any other normal
  table.
  <p/>
  The third statement (SELECT) will end up scanning all of the data in the table. 
  <p/>
  Once the temporary table has been defined, indexes can be placed on it to help improve
  performance.
  <p/>
  The final query (SELECT) will show the same contents as the previous SELECT statement, but faster.
  In the 'Console' tab on the bottom right panel, note the difference in time between statement 3 and statement 5.
