<h1 class="topictitle1">Temporary table spaces</h1>
<div><p>System temporary table spaces hold temporary data required by the
database manager while performing operations such as sorts or joins. </p>
<p>These types of operations require extra space to process the results set.
A database must have at least one system temporary table space; by default,
one system temporary table space called TEMPSPACE1 is created at database
creation time. IBMTEMPGROUP is the default database partition group for this
table space.</p>
<p>User temporary table spaces hold temporary data from tables created with

statement. To allow the definition of declared
temporary tables, at least one user temporary table space should be created
with the appropriate USE privileges. USE privileges are granted using the

 statement. A user temporary table space is <em>not</em> created by default

<p>It is recommended that you define a single SMS temporary table space with
a page size equal to the page size used in the majority of your regular table
spaces. This should be suitable for typical environments and workloads. However,
it can be advantageous to experiment with different temporary table space
configurations and workloads. The following points should be considered:</p>
<ul><li>Temporary tables are in most cases accessed in batches and sequentially.
That is, a batch of rows is inserted, or a batch of sequential rows is fetched.
Therefore, a larger page size typically results in better performance, because
fewer logical or physical page I/O requests are required to read a given amount
of data. This is not always the case when the average temporary table row
size is smaller than the page size divided by 255. A maximum of 255 rows can
exist on any page, regardless of the page size. For example, a query that
requires a temporary table with 15-byte rows would be better served by a 4
KB temporary table space page size, because 255 such rows can all be contained
within a 4 KB page. An 8 KB (or larger) page size would result in at least
4 KB (or more) bytes of wasted space on each temporary table page, and would
not reduce the number of required I/O requests.</li>
<li>If more than fifty percent of the regular table spaces in your database
use the same page size, it can be advantageous to define your temporary table
spaces with the same page size. The reason for this is that this arrangement
enables your temporary table space to share the same buffer pool space with
most or all of your regular table spaces. This, in turn, simplifies buffer
pool tuning.</li>
<li>When reorganizing a table using a temporary table space, the page size
of the temporary table space must match that of the table. For this reason,
you should ensure that there are temporary table spaces defined for each different
page size used by existing tables that you may reorganize using a temporary
table space. <p>You can also reorganize without a temporary table space by
reorganizing the table directly in the target table space. Of course, this
type of reorganization requires that there be extra space in the target table
space for the reorganization process.</p>
</li>
<li>If you are reliant on system temporary tables in SMS system
temporary table spaces because of your work environment, you may want to consider
using the registry variable DB2_SMS_TRUNC_TMPTABLE_THRESH. System temporary
tables are truncated to a file size of 0. The DB2_SMS_TRUNC_TMPTABLE_THRESH
can be used to leave the files at a non-zero size to avoid the performance
cost of repeated creations and truncations of the system temporary tables.
The need for a new system temporary table would have a performance cost associated
with it. Using this registry variable allows for leaving non-zero system temporary
tables on the system to avoid the performance cost of repeated creations and
truncations of system temporary tables.</li>
<li>In general, when temporary table spaces of differing page sizes exist,
the optimizer will choose the temporary table space whose buffer pool can
hold the most number of rows (in most cases that means the largest buffer
pool). In such cases, it is often wise to assign an ample buffer pool to one
of the temporary table spaces, and leave any others with a smaller buffer
pool. Such a buffer pool assignment will help ensure efficient utilization
of main memory. For example, if your catalog table space uses 4 KB pages,
and the remaining table spaces use 8 KB pages, the best temporary table space
configuration may be a single 8 KB temporary table space with a large buffer
pool, and a single 4 KB table space with a small buffer pool. </li>
<li>There is generally no advantage to defining more than one temporary table
space of any single page size.</li>
<li>SMS is almost always a better choice than DMS for temporary table spaces
because: <ul><li>There is more overhead in the creation of a temporary table when using
DMS versus SMS.</li>

<li>Disk space is allocated on demand in SMS, whereas it must be pre-allocated
in DMS. Pre-allocation can be difficult: Temporary table spaces hold transient
data that can have a very large peak storage requirement, and a much smaller
average storage requirement. With DMS, the peak storage requirement must be
pre-allocated, whereas with SMS, the extra disk space can be used for other
purposes during off-peak hours.</li>
<li>The database manager attempts to keep temporary table pages in memory,
rather than writing them out to disk. As a result, the performance advantages
of DMS are less significant.</li>
