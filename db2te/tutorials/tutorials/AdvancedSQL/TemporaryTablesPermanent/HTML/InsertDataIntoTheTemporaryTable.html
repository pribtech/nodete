The SQL statement will insert data into this temporary table.  The user
  can then take advantage of this temporary table to do further analysis.
  <p>The SQL statement is populating the table with all employees whose
  total pay (salary+bonus+comm) exceeds the average 
  pay of individuals in
  the company.  In other words, these people make more money than
  the average employee.
