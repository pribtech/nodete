You can create temporary tables using the summary table definition, but
  using the DEFINITION ONLY clause.  This is useful for users who need to
  use a subet of data over and over again.
<p>
Please note that since DB2 9.7, you can also use the 
<a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/t0054147.html');">CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</a>
statement to maintain the table across sessions.
For further information regarding the 
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement, please refer to the 
'Created Global Temporary Table' tutorial.
