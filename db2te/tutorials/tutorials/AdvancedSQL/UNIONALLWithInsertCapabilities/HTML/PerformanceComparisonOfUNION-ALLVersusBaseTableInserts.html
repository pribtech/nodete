This comparison shows the amount of time taken to insert records into a View of tables, and the
  individual table itself.  There is additional overhead required for DB2 to process inserts against
  a <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.dwe.sqw.doc/designing/data_flow/copunion.html');">UNION</a> of VIEWs since it must determine which base table the insert must be sent to.
