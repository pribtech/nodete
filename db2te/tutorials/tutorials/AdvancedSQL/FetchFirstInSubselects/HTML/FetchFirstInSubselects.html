<h2>fetch-first-clause</h2> <pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             .-1-------.                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&gt;&gt;-FETCH FIRST--+---------+--+-ROW--+--ONLY--------------------&gt;&lt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             '-<i>integer</i>-'  '-ROWS-'      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</pre><p>The fetch-first-clause sets
a maximum number of rows that can be retrieved. It lets the database manager
know that the application does not want to retrieve more than integer rows,
regardless of how many rows there might be in the result table when this clause
is not specified. An attempt to fetch beyond integer rows
is handled the same way as normal end of data (SQLSTATE 02000). The value
of integer must be a positive integer (not zero).</p>
 <p>Use of the fetch-first-clause influences
query optimization of the subselect or fullselect, based on the fact that
at most integer rows will be retrieved.   If both
the fetch-first-clause is specified in the outermost fullselect and the optimize-for-clause
is specified for the select statement, the database manager will use the integer from
the optimize-for-clause to influence query optimization of the outermost fullselect.
 </p>

<p>Limiting the result table to the first integer rows
can improve performance. The database manager will cease processing the query
once it has determined the first integer rows. 
 If both the fetch-first-clause and the optimize-for-clause are
specified, the lower of the integer values from
these clauses is used to influence the communications buffer size. </p>

 <p>If
the fullselect contains an SQL data change statement in the FROM clause, all
the rows are modified regardless of the limit on the number of rows to fetch.</p>

<div><h2>Examples of subselects</h2> <div><em>Example
A1:</em>&nbsp; Select all columns and rows from the EMPLOYEE table.  <pre>  <strong>SELECT * FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE</pre>
</div>
 <div><em>Example
A2:</em>&nbsp; Join the EMP_ACT and EMPLOYEE tables, select all the columns from
the EMP_ACT table and add the employee's surname (LASTNAME) from the EMPLOYEE
table to each row of the result.  <pre>   <strong>SELECT</strong> EMP_ACT.*, LASTNAME
     <strong>FROM</strong> EMP_ACT, EMPLOYEE
     <strong>WHERE</strong> EMP_ACT.EMPNO = EMPLOYEE.EMPNO</pre>

</div>
 <div><em>Example
A3:</em>&nbsp; Join the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT tables, select the employee number
(EMPNO), employee surname (LASTNAME), department number (WORKDEPT in the EMPLOYEE
table and DEPTNO in the DEPARTMENT table) and department name (DEPTNAME) of
all employees who were born (BIRTHDATE) earlier than 1930.  <pre>  <strong>SELECT</strong> EMPNO, LASTNAME, WORKDEPT, DEPTNAME 
    <strong> FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT                     
    <strong> WHERE</strong> WORKDEPT = DEPTNO     
    <strong> AND YEAR(</strong>BIRTHDATE<strong>)</strong> &lt; 1930</pre>

</div>
 <div class="p"><em>Example
A4:</em>&nbsp; Select the job (JOB) and the minimum and maximum salaries (SALARY)
for each group of rows with the same job code in the EMPLOYEE table, but only
for groups with more than one row and with a maximum salary greater than or
equal to 27000.  <pre>   <strong>SELECT</strong> JOB, <strong>MIN(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>, <strong>MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>

     <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE
     <strong>GROUP BY</strong> JOB
     <strong>HAVING COUNT(*)</strong> &gt; 1 
     <strong>AND MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong> &gt;= 27000</pre>

</div>
 <div><em>Example
A5:</em>&nbsp; Select all the rows of EMP_ACT table for employees (EMPNO) in department
(WORKDEPT) 'E11'. (Employee department numbers are shown in the EMPLOYEE table.)
 <pre>  <strong>SELECT *</strong>
    <strong>FROM</strong> EMP_ACT  
    <strong>WHERE</strong> EMPNO <strong>IN</strong>

             <strong>(SELECT</strong> EMPNO 
                 <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE  
                 <strong>WHERE</strong> WORKDEPT = 'E11'<strong>)</strong></pre>
</div>
 <div><em>Example A6:</em>&nbsp; From the EMPLOYEE table, select the department
number (WORKDEPT) and maximum departmental salary (SALARY) for all departments
whose maximum salary is less than the average salary for all employees.  <pre>  <strong>SELECT</strong> WORKDEPT, <strong>MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>) </strong>

    <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE 
    <strong>GROUP BY</strong> WORKDEPT  
    <strong>HAVING MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>) &lt; (SELECT AVG(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>
                              <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE<strong>)</strong></pre>

 The
subquery in the HAVING clause would only be executed once in this example.</div>
 <div><em>Example A7:</em>&nbsp; Using the EMPLOYEE table, select the department
number (WORKDEPT) and maximum departmental salary (SALARY) for all departments
whose maximum salary is less than the average salary in all other departments.
 <pre>  <strong>SELECT</strong> WORKDEPT, <strong>MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>
     <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE EMP_COR
     <strong> GROUP BY</strong> WORKDEPT 
     <strong> HAVING MAX(</strong>SALARY<strong>) &lt; (SELECT AVG(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>

                              <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE
                              <strong>WHERE NOT</strong> WORKDEPT = EMP_COR.WORKDEPT<strong>)</strong></pre>
</div>
 <p>In
contrast to <a href="#r0000875__exm6">Example A6</a>, the subquery in
the HAVING clause would need to be executed for each group. </p>
 <p id="r0000875__exm8"><a name="r0000875__exm8"><!-- --></a><em>Example
A8:</em>&nbsp; Determine the employee number and salary of sales representatives
along with the average salary and head count of their departments.</p>

 <div>This
query must first create a nested table expression (DINFO) in order to get
the AVGSALARY and EMPCOUNT columns, as well as the DEPTNO column that is used
in the WHERE clause.  <pre> <strong>SELECT</strong> THIS_EMP.EMPNO, THIS_EMP.SALARY, DINFO.AVGSALARY, DINFO.EMPCOUNT
  <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE THIS_EMP,
        <strong>(SELECT</strong> OTHERS.WORKDEPT <strong>AS</strong> DEPTNO,
                           <strong>AVG(</strong>OTHERS.SALARY<strong>) AS</strong> AVGSALARY,
                           <strong>COUNT(*) AS</strong> EMPCOUNT
          <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE OTHERS
          <strong>GROUP BY</strong> OTHERS.WORKDEPT
         <strong>) AS</strong> DINFO
  <strong>WHERE</strong> THIS_EMP.JOB = 'SALESREP'
   <strong>AND</strong> THIS_EMP.WORKDEPT = DINFO.DEPTNO</pre>

</div>
 <p>Using a
nested table expression for this case saves the overhead of creating the DINFO
view as a regular view. During statement preparation, accessing the catalog
for the view is avoided and, because of the context of the rest of the query,
only the rows for the department of the sales representatives need to be considered
by the view.</p>
 <p><em>Example A9:</em> Display the average education
level and salary for 5 random groups of employees.</p>
 <div class="p">This query requires
the use of a nested table expression to set a random value for each employee
so that it can subsequently be used in the GROUP BY clause.  <pre>  <strong>SELECT</strong> RANDID <strong>, AVG(</strong>EDLEVEL<strong>),</strong> <strong>AVG(</strong>SALARY<strong>)</strong>

    <strong>FROM (</strong> <strong>SELECT</strong> EDLEVEL, SALARY, INTEGER(RAND()*5) <strong>AS</strong> RANDID
             <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE
         <strong>) AS</strong> EMPRAND
    <strong>GROUP BY</strong> RANDID</pre>

</div>
 <div<em>Example A10:</em> Query
the EMP_ACT table and return those project numbers that have an employee whose
salary is in the top 10 of all employees.<pre>  <strong>SELECT</strong> EMP_ACT.EMPNO,PROJNO
     <strong>FROM</strong> EMP_ACT
     <strong>WHERE</strong> EMP_ACT.EMPNO <strong>IN</strong>

         <strong>(SELECT</strong> EMPLOYEE.EMPNO
          <strong>FROM</strong> EMPLOYEE
          <strong>ORDER BY</strong> SALARY <strong>DESC</strong>
          <strong>FETCH FIRST</strong> 10 <strong>ROWS ONLY)</strong></pre>

</div>
<div><em>Example
A11:</em> Assuming that PHONES and IDS are two SQL variables with array values
of the same cardinality, turn these arrays into a table with three columns
(one for each array and one for the position), and one row per array element.<pre>   <strong>SELECT</strong> T.PHONE, T.ID, T.INDEX <strong>FROM UNNEST</strong>(PHONES, IDS)
     <strong>WITH ORDINALITY AS</strong> T(PHONE, ID, INDEX)
     <strong>ORDER BY</strong> T.INDEX</pre>
