Let's assume that new data has arrived for a new quarter. Since we want the last
  four quarters of information, we need to load this information into the 
  FourQuarter View and get rid of the last quarter.  In order to do this, 
  the DBA would create a new tablespace (Q1_2002), create a new
  table in it (Q1_2002) and load information into it. This first set of SQL 
  creates the tablespace, table and loads the data into it.

If this tutorial has been run before, the first statement may fail because the tablespace already exists.
