The following step will DROP the first quarter of the year (Q1_2001) and then add the new
  quarter to the view.  Note that dropping the tablespace will not result in 
  any logging taking
  place.  This can substantially reduce the amount of log space that is taken up when trying 
  to get rid of a range of data.  We will also DROP the existing view to create the updated one.
