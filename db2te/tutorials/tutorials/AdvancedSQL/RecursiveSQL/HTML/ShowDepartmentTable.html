Here is the actual department table that we will be searching from.
  Note that there are two columns that have department numbers in
  it.  The first column (DEPTNO) is the actual department number,
  while the second column (ADMRDEPT) is the department that they
  report to.  The recursive query on the next page will return all of the departments
  that report to department A00 directly or indirectly.
