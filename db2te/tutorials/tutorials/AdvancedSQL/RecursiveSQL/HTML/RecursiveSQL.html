Recursive SQL is an interesting feature in DB2 UDB.  This SQL
  allows you to solve Bill-of-Material, Routing and other types
  of difficult problems - all with one SQL statement.
  The example shows the use of recursive SQL to find all of the
  departments that report to one department, either directly or
  indirectly.
