System sampling only looks at pages of data, rather than individual rows. While this
  will be more efficient in determining the answer set, it may produce more 
  variable results. This is particularly true if you are doing a calculation on a column
  which might be part of a clustering index. In this case, you may get a skew in results
  because pages that are matched will have the same clustered values on that page rather
  than a normal distribution.
