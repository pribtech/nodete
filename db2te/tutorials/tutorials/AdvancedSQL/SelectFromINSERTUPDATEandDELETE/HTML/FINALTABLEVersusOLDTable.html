The FINAL TABLE clause tells DB2 that the final state of the rows should be returned to the 
  SELECT statement. However, the SELECt statement can also get the contents of the records before
  they are changed (OLD) and the state of the record before referential integrity and trigger 
  activation (NEW). This example uses the OLD table to show the value of the rows before the change.
  The UPDATE statement is adding 20% to all employees whose salary is less than 20000.
  
  The Updated EMP_Profile table is then shown.
