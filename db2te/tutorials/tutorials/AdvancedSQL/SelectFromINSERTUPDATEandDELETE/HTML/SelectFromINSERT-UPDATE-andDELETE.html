DB2 UDB V8.1.4 now allows SELECT statements to be processed along with an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
  statement. This allows the developer to run one SQL statement that updates the corresponding data
  and at the same time returns the values of the rows that were changed. This eliminates the need
  to run a SELECT statement separate from the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. In addition, it may be 
  difficult to determine which rows are affected by the corresponding action, so this form of
  SQL guarantees that the actual rows affected will be returned.
  <P>The contents of the intermediate result table are dependant on the
  qualifier specified in the FROM clause. You must include one of the
  following FROM clause qualifiers in SELECT statements that retrieve result
  sets as intermediate result tables.

  <DL>
  <P>
    <DT>
      <B>OLD TABLE
      </B>
    </DT>
    <DD>The rows in the intermediate result table will contain values of the
  target table rows at the point immediately preceding the execution of before
  triggers and the SQL data-change operation. The OLD TABLE qualifier
  applies to UPDATE and DELETE operations.

    <P>
      <DT>
        <B>NEW TABLE
        </B>
      </DT>
      <DD>The rows in the intermediate result table will contain values of the
  target table rows at the point immediately after the SQL data-change statement
  has been executed, but before referential integrity evaluation and the firing
  of any after triggers. The NEW TABLE qualifier applies to UPDATE and
  INSERT operations.

      <P>
        <DT>
          <B>FINAL TABLE
          </B>
        </DT>
        <DD>This qualifier returns the same intermediate result table as NEW
  TABLE. In addition, the use of FINAL TABLE guarantees that no after
  trigger or referential integrity constraint will further modify the target of
  the UPDATE or INSERT operation. The FINAL TABLE qualifier applies to
  UPDATE and INSERT operations.
