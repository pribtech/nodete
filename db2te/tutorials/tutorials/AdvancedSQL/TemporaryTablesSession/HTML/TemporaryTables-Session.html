This section deals with the use of Temporary Tables.  Temporary tables are available during the
  duration of your session, or typically between the start of the transaction and the commit point.
  When a temporary table is created, any rows that are inserted or deleted from it are not logged.
  This results in much less overhead than when using regular database tables.
  <p>
  Each temporary table is unique per user.  This means that although the program may be shared amoung many
  users, the tables that are generated are UNIQUE for each user.  In order to specify that this 
  is a temporary table, the qualifer called SESSION is assigned to the particular table that is 
  being generated.

  <p>
<b>Note:</b> The
  database must have a tablespace set up specifically for temporary tables.
  If this is not done prior to running this SQL, an error will occur.
