The next SQL statement will create a temporary table that is valid for this session only.
  The <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/t0020127.html');">DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE</a> statement specifies the name of the temporary table (T1) and how it is defined.  In this
  example, the table is created based on the structure of another table (transactions).  This
  simplifies the creation of these tables since you do not need to know the structure of the table
  that you will extracting data from.
  <p>
  The clause "on commit preserve rows" means that if a commit statement is issued, the temporary table
  is kept "alive".  In this case, the table will only go away when you physically disconnect from 
  the system.  The "in db2demo" specifies the tablespace that will contain this temporary table.
  This tablespace must be defined beforehand in order for this SQL to work.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now that we have defined this table, we can insert data into it like any other normal
  table, and select information from it. Note the
  use of the SCHEMA name SESSION in order to specify that this is a temporary table that we are
  selecting from.  If we did not supply the high-level qualifier, the T1 table would not be found.

  Please note that once you leave this page, it will be considered as a new session, and 
  you will no longer be able to access the temporary table (T1).
