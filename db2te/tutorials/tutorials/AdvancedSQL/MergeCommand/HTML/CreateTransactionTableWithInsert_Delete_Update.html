This example will use a slightly different form of transaction table. Here the transaction
  records explicitly tell the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0010873.html');">MERGE</a> command what to do. 'I' records will insert new values, 'U' records will
  update existing records, and 'D' will delete records from the product table.
  If records are not matched, they are ignored. This means that deletes and updates of unknown product
  records will not take place, but no error record is generated.
  <p>This first example will fail because the transaction records contain a duplicate key value (3)
  for deletes.
