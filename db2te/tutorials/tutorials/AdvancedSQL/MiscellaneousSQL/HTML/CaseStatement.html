A case statement helps you to change values on input and output, as
  well as avoid situations like divide by zero.  For instance, you
  may have a table with shirt sizes (S, M, L) that you want to display
  as Small, Medium and Large on output.  You can do this by using the
  CASE statement to change the value on output.  You can also use this
  to convert the expanded values (like SMALL) into S on insert.
