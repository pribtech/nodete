The AS clause is useful when assigning a name to a calculation.  This
  can be used to give a meaningful name to a calculation in an SQL column,
  but it can also be used to avoid sorting errors.  Prior to 9.1,
  to sort on a calculation, you were required to give the relative
  column number in the ORDER BY clause, i.e.:<p/>
  <pre>
     SELECT SALARY+BONUS FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY 1
  </pre>
  <p>Now you can assign a name to this calculation and use that in the
  ORDER BY clause:</p>
  <pre>
     SELECT SALARY+BONUS AS PAY FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY PAY
  </pre>
  <p>This can help avoid a lot of mistakes in the SQL.
