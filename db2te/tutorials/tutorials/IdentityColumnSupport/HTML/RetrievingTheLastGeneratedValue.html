	You can get the last generated Identity value by using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r5/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0004231.html?noframes=true');">
	IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL </a> function.  This returns the generated IDENTITY value for the last INSERT statement.  
</p>
<p>
	What you should see is two result sets in the bottom right panel.  One of them
	displays the contents of the accounts_third table.  The last value in the table
	is of interest and has a value of 'Lastone' in name column and a generated value 
	in the acctno column.  The other result set	only has one value that is the same as the 
	acctno in the accounts_third table.
