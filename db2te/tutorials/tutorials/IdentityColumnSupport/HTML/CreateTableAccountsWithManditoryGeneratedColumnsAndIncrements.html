<p>
	Run the statements in the right panel.
</p>
<p>
	The accounts table is recreated, but this time the starting value
  is 100 and the increment is 10.  This behaviour is changed by including
  the 'start with' and 'increment by' options.
</p>
<p>  
	Records are inserted into the database.  As each new row is inserted,
	the identity value increased by 10 now instead of 1.
</p>
<p>
  You should see the contents of the table.  The account numbers should be generated, 
  starting at the number 100 and incrementing by 10.
