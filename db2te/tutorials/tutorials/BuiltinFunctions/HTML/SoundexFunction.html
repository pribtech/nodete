  returns a 4-byte value that represents the "sound" of the string.
  Of course, this function is highly dependent on the English language,
  so it will not necessarily return the correct results in other
  languages.  However, a function like this useful when you are
  trying to find a value that "sounds like" something.  The following
  example lists all employees in the company that have names that
  sound like 'SYMTH'.
