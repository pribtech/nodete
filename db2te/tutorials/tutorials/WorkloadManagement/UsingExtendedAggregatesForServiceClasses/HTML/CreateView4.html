  The fourth and final view will be used to show the histograms
  themselves. It also demonstrates a common task when dealing with
  histograms, which is to aggregate them over time. This view shows the
  top of each bin and the number of activities that were counted towards
  each bin. Of the two histograms covered below, the BIN_TOP field
  measures the number of milliseconds in the activity inter-arrival time
  and the number of timerons in the estimated cost. When BIN_TOP is,
  3000 milliseconds and the BIN_TOP of the previous bin is 2000
  milliseconds and the NUMBER_IN_BIN is ten for an inter-arrival time
  histogram you know that there were ten activities which each arrived
  into the system between 2 and 3 seconds after the arrival of the
  previous activity, for example.
