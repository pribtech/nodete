  A second view makes it easier to find out what service classes are
  having histograms collected for them. The HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS
  table reports the service class for which the histogram is being
  collected by giving the service class ID.  Joining this table with the
  SERVICECLASSES catalog table will allow the service class information
  to be presented with the service super class name and service subclass
  name instead of the service class ID.
