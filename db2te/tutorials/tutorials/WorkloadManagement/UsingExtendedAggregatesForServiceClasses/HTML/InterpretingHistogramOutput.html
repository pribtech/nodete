  The same query can be repeated with a histogram_type of
  CoordActEstCost instead of CoordActInterArrivalTime.

  A histogram like this is typical for a small workload. With a small
  workload, there is not much variation in the size of activities, so
  there are only a few different bins that had activities counted
  towards them. From this result, you can tell how many
  of the activities had a cost estimate less than 19 timerons, 
  for example.
