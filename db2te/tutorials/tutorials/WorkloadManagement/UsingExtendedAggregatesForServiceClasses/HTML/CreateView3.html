  The third view lists all of the times that a histogram of a given type
  was collected for a given service class. Like the
  HISTOGRAMSERVICECLASSES view, it joins the HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS
  table with the SERVICECLASSES catalog table. The difference is in the
  STATISTICS_TIMESTAMP column which is included as one of the columns in
  this view.
