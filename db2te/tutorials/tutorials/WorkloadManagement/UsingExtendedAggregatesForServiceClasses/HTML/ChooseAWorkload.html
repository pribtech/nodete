Now some activities can be run. After the activities have finished,
  the WLM_COLLECT_STATS stored procedure is called to send the
  statistics (including the activity lifetime, execution time and queue
  time histograms for the default user service class) to the active
  statistics event monitor. These histograms contain data about all
  activities that executed in the default user service class since
  aggregate activity statistics were enabled. Calling this stored
  procedure also resets the statistics. To show changes in database
  activity over time, three collection intervals are created.  
  <p>
  Choose from one of the three workloads and then run the histogram examples.

  Collecting data periodically like this allows you to watch how work on
  your system changes over time. Collecting data periodically does not need to
  be a manual operation. Using the WLM_COLLECT_INT database
  configuration parameter, one can set the interval in minutes after
  which statistics collection and reset automatically occurs.
