<p>This sample demonstrates how to use the COLLECT AGGREGATE ACTIVITY
  DATA EXTENDED option on a service class to produce histograms of
  coordinator activity inter-arrival times and estimated costs. The
  inter-arrival time is the time between the arrival of one activity
  into the system and the arrival of the next activity. The estimated
  cost of an activity is the estimated system resources that will be
  used in the execution of the activity and it only applies to DML
  activities. An inter-arrival time histogram can be useful for
  correlating with a lifetime histogram or other lifetime statistics for
  determining whether a change in lifetime statistics was the result of
  a change in the arrival rate of the workload versus being the result
  of a change in the complexity of the workload (e.g. more complex
  queries) or a change in the system. The estimated cost histogram can
  be useful for correlating with the inter-arrival time and lifetime
  histograms to see whether a change in the lifetime histogram could be
  due to a change in the complexity of the workload load (e.g. more
  complex queries with higher estimated costs being submitted), due to a
  change in the arrival rate of activities (determined from the
  inter-arrival time distribution) or due to a change in the system
  itself, such as the introduction of a new threshold, a change in the
  priority given to a service class, or a change in hardware.

  Histograms are accessed through the statistics event monitor.  This
  task reuses the statistics event monitor created in an earlier step.
