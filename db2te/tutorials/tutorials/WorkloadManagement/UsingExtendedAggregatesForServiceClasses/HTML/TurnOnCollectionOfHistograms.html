Turning on the collection of histograms is done for the default user
  service class by altering its default subclass to collect aggregate
  activity data with the EXTENDED option.  This provides both the three
  histograms available in the BASE option (lifetime, execution time, and
  queue time) and the two histograms available only when using the
  EXTENDED option (inter-arrival time and estimated cost).
