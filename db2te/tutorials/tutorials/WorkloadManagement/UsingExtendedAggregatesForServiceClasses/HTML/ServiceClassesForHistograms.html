The HISTOGRAMSERVICECLASSES view allows you to see the service classes
  for which a histogram was collected. The example below restricts the
  output to that of the CoordActInterArrivalTime histogram only. Since
  aggregate activity collection was turned on only for the default user
  service class's default subclass, only that class is shown when
  selecting from the HISTOGRAMSERVICECLASSES view.
