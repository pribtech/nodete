<p>The last view, HISTOGRAMS, is for looking at the histograms
  themselves. Unlike the HISTOGRAMTIMES view that lists each collection
  interval as its own row, this view aggregates histogram data across
  multiple intervals to produce a single histogram of a given type for a
  given service class.
  </p><p>Running theis query produces 41 
  bins and all of the largest bins are empty. At the top, there is a bin
  whose BIN_TOP is -1. This bin represents all of those activities whose
  inter-arrival time was too large to fit in the histogram. Seeing a
  NUMBER_OF_BIN greater than zero when the BIN_TOP is -1 indicates that
  you should probably increase the high bin value of your histogram. In
  the output, the NUMBER_IN_BIN should be 0, so there is no need to make
  such a change. From this result, you can find out the number of milliseconds
  apart from each other that the majority of activities arrived at.
