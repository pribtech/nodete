<p>You will be creating several views in the next pages to make querying the HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS
  table easier. The HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS table was created when the event monitor DB2STATISTICS was created.  Please see the 'Getting Started with Basic Monitoring' tutorial in this workshop for more detail on event monitors.

  The first view lists all of the histogram types
  available. In this task, it reports just the three basic types:
  lifetime, execution time and queue time.
