Work action sets are used to apply an action to an activity based on
  what the activity is doing rather than who submitted it (as is done
  with workloads).  This task demonstrates how a work action set can be
  used to: 
  <ol>
  <li>collect information about all activities of a certain type </li>
  <li>apply a threshold to all activities of a certain type </li> 
  <li>isolate activities of a certain type by mapping them to a specific service subclass </li>
   </ol>
  <p>
  Actions can be applied to either:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>all database activities of a certain type (using a database work action set) </li>
  <li>to only activities of a certain type  in a particular service class (using a service class work action set). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This task shows both methods.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are other actions can be applied, such
  as collecting statistics for activities of a certain type that are not
  covered in this task.
