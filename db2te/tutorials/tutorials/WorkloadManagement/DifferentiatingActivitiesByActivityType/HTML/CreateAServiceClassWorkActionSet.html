<p>Create a work action set at the service class level that contains work
  actions that apply to the specific work classes representing the types

For this example, assume we want to
  collect activity data for all DDL, read, and load activities that run
  under the work1_sc service class and we also want to map read
  activities to a separate service subclass so that we can treat them
  differently; in this case, a threshold will be applied to the service
  subclass to stop any large SELECT statements from running.</p>
