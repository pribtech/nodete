Use the WLM_GET_WORK_ACTION_SET_STATS table function to access the
  work action set statistics in memory to get the number of times
  specific activity types have been run.  Note that running the
  following query shows only the load_wc, ddl_wc, and the read_wc work
  classes since they are the only three work classes that have a work
  action applied to them.  All the other activities end up being counted
  under *.
  <p>
  Notice again, that one of the activities has a SQLCODE of -4712, this
  time because of the stop_large_activities service class threshold that
  was created in step 9 that was breached because the estimated cost for
  that select statement was too large.  Also notice that all read
  activities are being run under the work1_sc_read service subclass.
