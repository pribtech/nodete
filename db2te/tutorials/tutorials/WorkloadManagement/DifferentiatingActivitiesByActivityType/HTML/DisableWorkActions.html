Before moving on to the service class work action set, drop the
  database work action set.
  <p>
  Additional information: Before dropping any concurrency threshold,
  that threshold must first be disabled.  In this case, there are no
  work actions that represent a concurrency threshold but if there were,
  the only way to disable it would be by disabling the work action.  A
  work action threshold cannot be manipulated through THRESHOLD SQL
  statements; they can be manipulated only through WORK ACTION SET SQL
  statements.  Only work actions that represent concurrency thresholds
  need to be disabled before dropping the subsequent work action set. 
  For this task, because there are no work actions that represent a
  concurrency threshold, there is no need to disable any of the work
  actions before dropping the work action set.

  If you want to perform a particular action, such as a threshold, to
  all the activities of a certain type running in a service super class,
  you should consider using a service class work action set.  You can
  create a mapping work action to map specific types of activities to a
  specific service subclass and then apply a threshold to that service
  subclass.  The following steps demonstrate how service class work
  action sets might be used
