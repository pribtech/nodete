<p> First, create a work class set containing work classes that will
  represent the specific types of activities you are interested in using the   
  <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0050577.html?noframes=true');">
CREATE WORK CLASS SET</a> statement.
</p><p> 
  This work class set will be used in conjunction with work action sets
  to perform actions on the selected types of activities. Below is an
  example that creates a work class set containing work classes of all
  possible types in DB2 9.5 but if you were only interested in one
  activity type, your work class set could be created to only contain
  that one work class.</p>
