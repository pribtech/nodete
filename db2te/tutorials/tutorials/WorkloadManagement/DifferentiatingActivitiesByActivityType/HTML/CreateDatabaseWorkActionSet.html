<p>If you want to perform a particular action on all activities of a
  specific type (such as apply a threshold or collect activity
  information), use a database work action set.  This is done with the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow

CREATE WORK ACTION SET</a> statement.  
 </p> <p>
  Create a work action set at the database level that contains work
  actions for the specific work class representing the type of
  activities you want isolated.  For this example, assume we want to
  collect activity data for all DDL, READ and LOAD activities that run
  on the system and we also want to stop any large read activity from
  running.  For this task, a large read activity is any select statement
  that has an estimated cost (in timerons) of greater than 10000.
