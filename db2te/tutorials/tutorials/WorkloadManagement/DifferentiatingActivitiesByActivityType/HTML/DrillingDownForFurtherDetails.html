To drill down further and get some additional information about each
  activity such as the activity text and what service class it ran
  under, you can perform a query similar to this one.
  <p>
  Notice that one of the activities has an 
  <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.messages.sql.doc/doc/msql04712n.html?noframes=true');">
SQLCODE of -4712.</a> This
  indicates execution of the activity was stopped due to a threshold
  violation. The threshold defined for the stop_large_read_wa work
  action will prevent any SELECT statement with an estimated cost of
  greater than 10000 from executing.
  </p>
  <p>
  Load activities (not including load from a
  cursor) do not have an entry in the activity statement event monitor
  table  (activitystmt_db2activities table) which explains why there is
  no record for the single load activity that is run by the work1.db2
  script in the output shown in the last query above.  The reason for
  this is that load activities are not SQL statements.  For load from
  cursor activities, there is an entry for the cursor statement in the
  activity statement event monitor table because the cursor itself is a
  separate activity. There is an entry for all load activities in the
  activity event monitor table (activity_db2activities).
