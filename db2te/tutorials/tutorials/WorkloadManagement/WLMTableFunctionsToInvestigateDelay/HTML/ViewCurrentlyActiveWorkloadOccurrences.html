<p>The 'WLM_tut_app2' script should now be hanging.  Issue
  table function <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0054685.html?noframes=true');">
WLM_GET_SERVICE_CLASS_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCES_V97</a> table function to find the
  states of all applications running on the database.

If you are using a 9.5 database, you will need to run the 
<a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0052916.html?noframes=true');">
WLM_GET_SERVICE_CLASS_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCES</a> table function instead.  Since DB2 9.7, this table function has been deprecated and replaced by the WLM_GET_SERVICE_CLASS_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCES_V97 table function.  
Click on the 'Edit mode' button in the top right panel, and edit the SQL before clicking on 'Run.'
</p> <p>For this example,
  you can think of a workload occurrence as the same as an application.
  This table function shows information for all workload occurrences in
  a service class.  Since we want to see all workload occurrences in the
  database, we use wildcards represented by '' as
  service_superclass_name and service_subclass_name input parameters.
  <p>
  From the output, you need to find the application handle for
  'WLM_tut_app2'. Remember that value!
