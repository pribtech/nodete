You can use thresholds to detect resource misuse or the
  beginning of system overload by establishing limits over the
  consumption of a specific resource.  If a threshold is
  violated, a specified action can be triggered.  The
  supported actions are:
  <ul>
  <li>STOP EXECUTION  Stop processing the activity that
      caused the threshold to be violated. </li>
  <li>CONTINUE  Continue processing </li>
  <li>Collect information about the activity that violated
      the threshold.  This action can be specified in conjunction
      with the CONTINUE or STOP EXECUTION action. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Regardless of whether an activity that violates a threshold
  is stopped or allowed to continue running, a record of the
  violation is written to an active THRESHOLD VIOLATIONS even
  monitor (assuming one is defined in advance) each time a
  threshold is violated.  The record contains information such
  as which threshold was violated, the time of the violation,
  and the threshold action. </p>

  This task demonstrates how thresholds can be used to detect
  or prevent rogue activities from running on your system and
  using up system resources.  A rogue activity is any activity
  that uses an unexpectedly high amount of resources. For
  example, a query that runs for an abnormally long time, or
  returns an unexpectedly large result set.
