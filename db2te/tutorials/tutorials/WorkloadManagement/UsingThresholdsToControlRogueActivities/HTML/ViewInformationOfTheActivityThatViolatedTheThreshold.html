Activity information is collected for any activity that
  violates a threshold that is defined with a COLLECT clause. 
  Show the detailed information about the activities that
  violated a threshold using the following query.
  <p>
  Notice that the activity that violated the th_estcost
 (EstimatedSqlCost) threshold is not shown.  The reason is
  because that threshold did not specify the COLLECT ACTIVITY
  DATA clause so no activity data was collected for that
  activity. </p>
