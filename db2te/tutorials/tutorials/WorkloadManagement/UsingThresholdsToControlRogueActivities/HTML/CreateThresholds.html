Create two thresholds, one of which (th_estcost) is an
  ESTIMATEDSQLCOST threshold and another (th_sqlrows) is a
  SQLROWSRETURNED threshold and apply them to the service
  class you wish to control the activities for (in this case,
  work1_sc service class) using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0050563.html?noframes=true');">CREATE THRESHOLD</a> statement. 
  <p>
  The th_estcost threshold specifies an upper bound (10000
  timerons) for the optimizer-estimated cost (in timerons) for
  an activity running in the work1_sc service class. If any
  query with an estimated cost greater than 100 timerons,
  tries to execute in the work1_sc service class, this
  threshold is violated and the query is not allowed to run. </p>
  <p>
  The th_sqlrows threshold specifies that any activity running
  in the work1_sc service class can return at most 30 rows
  from the data server. If any query tries to return more than
  30 rows, this threshold is violated, only 30 rows will be
  returned to the client and the query will be stopped.  In
  addition, data about the activity that caused the threshold
  violation will be collected. </p>
  <p>
  In either case, when an activity violates the threshold, a
  threshold violation record is written to the THRESHOLD
  VIOLATIONS event monitor as defined in step 1 and the
  execution of the activity is stopped (because of the STOP
  EXECUTION action). The application that submitted the
  activity will receive an SQL4712N error. </p>
  <p>
  Additional information: A threshold can be either predictive
  or reactive: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Predictive threshold: The boundaries of a predictive
  threshold are checked before the activity starts running. To
  check whether a predictive threshold would be violated, the
  data server obtains usage estimates from the SQL compiler.
  For this example, the th_estcost threshold is a predictive
  threshold. </li>
    
  <li>Reactive threshold: The boundaries of a reactive
  threshold are checked while an activity is executing.
  Approximate runtime usage estimates of the controlled
  resource are used to evaluate the boundaries of reactive
  thresholds. The runtime usage estimates are not obtained
  continuously but rather at selected predefined checkpoints
  during the lifetime of the tracked work. For this example,
  the th_sqlrows is a reactive threshold.  </li>
  </ul>
