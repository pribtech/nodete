<p> This step enables collection of aggregate activity statistics for the
  default subclass under the default user service class using

</p>
<p>When this clause
  is specified, aggregate statistics will be maintained in
  memory for the corresponding service class (for example,
  statistics like average activity lifetime). The in-memory
  statistics can be viewed using the service subclass
  statistics table function, or can be collected and sent to
  the active statistics event monitor for later analysis.</p>
