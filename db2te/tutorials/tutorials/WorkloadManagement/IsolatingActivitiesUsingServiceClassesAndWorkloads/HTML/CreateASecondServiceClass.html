<p>Create a second service class and then create a workload
  such that all activities run from the WLM_tutorial_wk2 application
  get mapped to the newly created service class. In addition,
  set up the workload so that it will collect some activity
  data. For this example, we will just collect activity data
  without any additional details or values.

  clause is specified for a workload, information about any
  activity submitted by an occurrence of that workload will be
  sent to the active ACTIVITIES event monitor when the

  you to specify how much information should be collected by
  applying one of the following options:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>WITHOUT DETAILS - Collect activity information
      without statement and compilation environment (the default) </li>
  <li>WITH DETAILS - Collect activity information
      including statement and compilation environment. </li>
  <li>WITH DETAILS AND VALUES - Collect activity
      information including statement and compilation environment,
      and input data values. </li>
  </ul>
