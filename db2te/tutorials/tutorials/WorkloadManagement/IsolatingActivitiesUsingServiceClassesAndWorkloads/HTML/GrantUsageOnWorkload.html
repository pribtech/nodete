  A connection can only be associated
  with a workload if the session user has USAGE privilege on
  the workload. This is necessary to prevent users from
  changing connection attributes of their application in an
  attempt to run their work in a higher priority service
  class. Some connection attributes can be changed
  programmatically (e.g. using the sqleseti API). In this
  task, we will just grant USAGE privilege to PUBLIC. You
  would want to be more discriminating on a real system.
