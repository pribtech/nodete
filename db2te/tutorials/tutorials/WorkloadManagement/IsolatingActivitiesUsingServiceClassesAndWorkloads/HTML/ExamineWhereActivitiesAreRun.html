 <p>First examine where activities are executed if there is no
  user defined service class or workload. All activities in
  DB2 are assigned to a workload and run in a service class.
  If no user defined service classes are created, activities
  run in the default subclass (SYSDEFAULTSUBCLASS) under the
  default user service class (SYSDEFAULTUSERCLASS) and if no
  user defined workloads are created, activities run under the
  default user workload (SYSDEFAULTUSERWORKLOAD).
  </p><p>
  Run the statement to the right and then examine the
  in-memory statistics for the SYSDEFAULTSUBCLASS of
  SYSDEFAULTUSERCLASS using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0053580.html?noframes=true');">WLM_GET_SERVICE_SUBCLASS_STATS_V97</a>table function.
  </p>
  <p>
If you are using a 9.5 database, you will need to run the 
<a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0052917.html?noframes=true');">WLM_GET_SERVICE_SUBCLASS_STATS</a> table function instead.  Since DB2 9.7, this table function has been deprecated and replaced by the WLM_GET_SERVICE_SUBCLASS_STATS_V97 table function.  
Click on the 'Edit mode' button in the top right panel, and edit the SQL before clicking on 'Run.'
</p>
  <p>
  Notice all the activities are run in the SYSDEFAULTUSERCLASS
  service super class. 
  </p>
  <p>  
  Additional Information: There are 2 other service classes as
  well, SYSDEFAULTSYSTEMCLASS and SYSDEFAULTMAINTENANCECLASS.
  These service classes are used for internal maintenance and
  system level tasks. User activities will not run in these
  service classes. You may notice nonzero activity counts in
  these service classes as well if DB2 has issued any internal
  activities.
