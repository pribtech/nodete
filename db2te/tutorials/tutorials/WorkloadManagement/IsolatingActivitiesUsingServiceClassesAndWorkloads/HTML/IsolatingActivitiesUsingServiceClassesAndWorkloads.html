This section demonstrates how to create service classes
  and how to send activities to a service class using a
  workload.
  In addition, it also demonstrates how to use some of the
  WLM monitoring features to determine the workload that
  activities  are being mapped to and to get information about
  activities being run in a service class and under a
  workload.
  <p>
  Service classes are the primary point of resource control
  for database activities. They are also useful for
  monitoring. For example, you can collect statistics for
  activities in a particular service class to determine
  whether the performance goals for that service class are
  being met. Since DB2 9.5, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow

  (SYSDEFAULTSYSTEMCLASS, SYSDEFAULTMAINTENANCECLASS, and
  SYSDEFAULTUSERCLASS)</a> are created for each database.  If no
  user defined service classes are created, user activities
  are run under the default user service class
  (SYSDEFAULTUSERCLASS).

  A workload is an entity that groups one or more units of
  work based on criteria such as system user ID, session user
  ID, etc.  Workloads provide a means of assigning work to a
  service class so that the work can later be managed. Since DB2
  9.5, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.wlm.doc/doc/c0051473.html?noframes=true');">a default user workload (SYSDEFAULTUSERWORKLOAD) and a
  default administration workload (SYSDEFAULTADMWORKLOAD)</a> are
  created for each database.  If no user defined workloads are
  created, all user activities are associated with the default
  user workload.
