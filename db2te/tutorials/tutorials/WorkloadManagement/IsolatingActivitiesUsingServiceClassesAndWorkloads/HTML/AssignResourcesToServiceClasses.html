<p>Now that you have isolated the activities issued by these
  two scripts into separate service classes, you can assign
  resources to the service classes or monitor the activities
  that run in those service classes. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, if you wanted to capture details about every individual
  activity that executes
  in the WORK2_SC service class, you could enable activity
  collection for that service class using an <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0050551.html?noframes=true');">
ALTER SERVICE CLASS</a> statement as shown on the right. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If the work performed by WLM_tutorial_wl2 is more
  important than the work performed by the script work1.db2,
  you could increase the priority of agents running in the
  WORK2_SC service class using a ALTER SERVICE CLASS statement like:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><i>On UNIX:</i> ALTER SERVICE CLASS WORK2_SC AGENT PRIORITY -6 (On
  UNIX, a negative value specifies a higher priority)
  </li>
  <li>
  <i>On Windows:</i> ALTER SERVICE CLASS WORK2_SC AGENT PRIORITY 6
(On Windows a positive value specifies a higher priority)</li>
  </ul>
