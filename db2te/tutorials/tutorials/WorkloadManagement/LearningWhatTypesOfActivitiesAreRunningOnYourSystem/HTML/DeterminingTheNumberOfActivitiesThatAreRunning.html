<p>Additional Information: Before starting, you might want to show the
  number of activities of a certain type that are currently running by
  using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0054928.html?noframes=true');">
WLM_GET_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCE_ACTIVITIES_V97</a> table function.
  </p>
  <p>
If you are using a 9.5 database, you will need to run the 
<a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow
('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0052920.html?noframes=true');">
WLM_GET_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCE_ACTIVITIES</a> table function instead.  Since DB2 9.7, this table function has been deprecated and replaced by the WLM_GET_WORKLOAD_OCCURRENCE_ACTIVITIES_V97 table function.  
Click on the 'Edit mode' button in the top right panel, and edit the SQL before clicking on 'Run.'

  To get information about the different types of activities that have
  run on your system over a given period of time, you can use work class
  sets and work actions.
