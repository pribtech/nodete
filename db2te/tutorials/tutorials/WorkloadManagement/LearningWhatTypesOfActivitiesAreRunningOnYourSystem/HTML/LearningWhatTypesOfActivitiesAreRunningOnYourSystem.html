<p>This task demonstrates how you can use the workload management
  monitoring table functions and work action sets to determine what
  types of activities are running on your system. 
  </p><p>For example: You might
  want to know the number of large activities or load utilities that are
  being run concurrently on your system.  Understanding the types of
  work being run on the system is important as different types of work
  will have different resource requirements and impacts on system
  performance.</p>
