<p>To count the number of times an activity of a specific type has been
  run over a period of time, a work action set needs to be created. In
  this example, because we are interested in the activities that are run
  on the entire system, the work action set will be created at the
  database level and is associated with the all_class_types work class set
  created by the first SQL statement (for more detail about work class sets, 
  please refer to the 'Differentiation Activities by Activity Type' tutorial 
  of this workshop).  If you've already run other tutorials in this 
  workshop, this work class set may already have been created.  </p>
  <p>This work class set contains
  work classes for all types of recognized activities. If we were only
  interested in the activities being run in a specific service class, we
  would create a work action set at the service class level. For this
  example, we are also interested in the information for all types of
  activities so that the work action set contains a COUNT ACTIVITY work
  action for each work class in the all_class_types work class set.</p>
  <p>
  Additional information: Each time an activity corresponding to a work
  class has one or more work actions applied to it, a counter for the
  work class is incremented by one. The COUNT ACTIVITY work action
  provides an efficient way to ensure that the counter is updated. If no
  work action is applied to an activity corresponding to a work class,
  the work class is treated as though it does not exist, no activity is
  associated with it, and the counter will not be incremented. If you do
  not want to perform any other action on an activity other than
  counting the number of activities of that type that have been run, the
  COUNT ACTIVITY work action is the best approach.
