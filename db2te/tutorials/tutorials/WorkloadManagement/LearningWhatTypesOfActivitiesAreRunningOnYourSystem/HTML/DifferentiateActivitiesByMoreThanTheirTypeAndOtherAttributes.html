<p>You can separate out activities by more than just their types. For
  example, you might want to know how many large queries are being run.
  </p><p>
  Alter the work class set to add a new read work class that will
  represent large queries. For this example, a large query is any query
  that has a cardinality greater than 40.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that we positioned this work class at
  position 1. If the "POSITION AT" clause is not specified, the work
  class is positioned at the bottom of the work class set. When deciding
  which work class an activity belongs to, the work classes are checked
  in the order they are positioned and the first work class whose
  attributes match the activities attributes is the class that the
  activity gets assigned to. In this case, if the large_wc were
  positioned at the end of the list, the large activities would have
  been assigned to the read_wc since it was positioned ahead of
  large_wc.
