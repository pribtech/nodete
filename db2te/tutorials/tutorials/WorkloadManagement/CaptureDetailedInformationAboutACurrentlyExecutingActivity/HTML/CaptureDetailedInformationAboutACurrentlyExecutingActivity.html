WLM_CAPTURE_ACTIVITY_IN_PROGRESS</a> procedure to capture detailed
  information about a currently executing activity for later historical
  analysis. Activity information you capture is sent to the active event
  monitor for activities.
  </p><p>
  Previous tasks showed how the COLLECT ACTIVITY DATA clause is used for
  workloads, service classes, work actions and thresholds to capture
  detailed activity information. This clause needs to be specified in
  advance before an activity begins executing and information is sent to
  the activities event monitor when the activity completes.  The
  WLM_CAPTURE_ACTIVITY_IN_PROGRESS procedure allows you to capture
  information reactively when you notice a problem with an activity
  already in progress. When this procedure is used, information about an
  activity is sent to the activities event monitor immediately. Both
  basic and statement activity information are collected, but not input
  data.
