WLM_CAPTURE_ACTIVITY_IN_PROGRESS</a> procedure contain somewhat less
  information than if the COLLECT ACTIVITY DATA clause were used,
  because the activity is captured before it has completed execution. In
  particular, fields like the completion timestamp (which shows only
  zeros) and the sqlcode do not apply. You can determine if an activity
  was collected using the WLM_CAPTURE_ACTIVITY_IN_PROGRESS procedure by
  looking at the PARTIAL_RECORD column in the ACTIVITY table. If the
  PARTIAL_RECORD column has a value of 1 (as shown above), activity
  information was collected using WLM_CAPTURE_ACTIVITY_IN_PROGRESS. If
  the PARTIAL_RECORD column has a value of 0, activity information was
  collected after completion with the COLLECT ACTIVITY DATA clause.
