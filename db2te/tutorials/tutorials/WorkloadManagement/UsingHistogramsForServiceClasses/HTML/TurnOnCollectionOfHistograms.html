The activity lifetime, queue time, and execution time histograms are
  collected for a service subclass when the base collect aggregate
  activity data option is enabled for the subclass.  Enable the base
  aggregate activity data collection for the default subclass under the
  default user super class using the COLLECT AGGREGATE ACTIVITY DATA
  clause.
  Note that all activities will be run in the default user service class
  since all the user defined workloads were disabled at the end of the
  previous task.
