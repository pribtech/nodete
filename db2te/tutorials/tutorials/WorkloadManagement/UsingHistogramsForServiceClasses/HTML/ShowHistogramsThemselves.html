The fourth and final view will be used to show the histograms themselves. It also demonstrates something that one often needs to do when dealing with histograms, which is to aggregate them over time. This view shows the top of each bin and the number of activities that were counted towards each bin. For the three histograms in this exercise, the BIN_TOP field measures the number of milliseconds in the activity lifetime, execution time or queue time. When BIN_TOP is, say 3000 milliseconds and the BIN_TOP of the previous bin is 2000 milliseconds and the NUMBER_IN_BIN is ten for a lifetime histogram, you know that ten activities had a lifetime that was between 2 and 3 seconds.
