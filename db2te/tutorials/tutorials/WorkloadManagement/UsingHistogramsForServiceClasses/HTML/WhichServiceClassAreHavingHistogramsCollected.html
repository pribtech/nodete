A second view makes it easier to find out which service classes are having histograms collected for them. The HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS table identifies the service classes for which histograms are being collected using the service class ID. Joining this table with the SERVICECLASSES catalog table allows the service class information to be presented with the service super class name and service subclass name instead of the service class ID.
