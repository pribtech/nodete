The last several queries looked at activity lifetimes, execution times
  and queue times broken down into bins but aggregated across multiple
  intervals. The following query presents the same information from a
  different perspective. It shows averages instead of histograms and,
  rather than combining the intervals, it shows each interval
  individually. It also reports a count of the number of completed
  activities which shows how many activities completed in each interval.
  It uses the SCSTATS_DB2STATISTICS table instead of the
  HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS table.
  <p>
  The result shows that average lifetimes are slightly higher than
  average execution times for each interval and all three are just over
  a half a second or less. The average queue time, as expected, is zero.
  
  <!-- 
  The counts of the number of completed activities in each interval is
  as expected because workloads 1 and 2 were run in the first interval
  which resulted in 77 activities collected, workload 1 ran alone in the
  second interval which resulted in 39 activities, and workload 1 ran
  twice and workload 2 ran once in the third interval, which resulted in
  113 activities. -->
