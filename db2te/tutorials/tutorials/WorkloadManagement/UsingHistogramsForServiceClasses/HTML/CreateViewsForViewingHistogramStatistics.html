<p> In the next few pages, we will create several views to make querying the HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS
  table easier. The HISTOGRAMBIN_DB2STATISTICS table is created when the event monitor DB2STATISTICS is created.  Please see the 'Getting Started with Basic Monitoring' tutorial in this workshop for more detail on event monitors.  
</p><p>The first view lists all of the histogram types
  available. This task reports just the three basic types:lifetime,
  execution time and queue time.</p>
