The HISTOGRAMS view will be used to look at the
  CoordActQueueTime histogram. This is the simplest histogram because
  there is no queuing, since no queuing thresholds were created or
  enabled in this task.
  <p>
  Every activity was counted in the 0 to 1 millisecond bin because every
  activity spent zero milliseconds queuing.
