  <p>This task demonstrates how to use the COLLECT AGGREGATE ACTIVITY DATA
  BASE option on a service class to produce histograms of coordinator
  activity lifetimes, coordinator activity execution times, and
  coordinator activity queue times. These three histograms are useful
  for knowing more than just the average lifetime, execution time, or
  queue time of the activities run on the system, since they can be used
  to calculate standard deviations and can reveal outliers.

  management in the DB2 Information Center (also shown on the right).
  Histograms are accessed through the statistics event monitor.

  <p>
  The statistics event monitor is a
  write-to-table event monitor and contains logical data groups.   The
  first is the control logical data group, which every event monitor
  has, and then there are the logical data groups that are specific to
  the statistics event monitor type. Those are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>histogrambin for histogram information </li>
  <li>qstats for threshold queue statistics </li>
  <li>scstats service class statistics </li>
  <li>wcstats for work class statistics </li>
  <li>wlstats for workload statistics. </li>
  </ul>
