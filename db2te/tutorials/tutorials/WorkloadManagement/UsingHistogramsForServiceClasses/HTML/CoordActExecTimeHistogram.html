The same query can be repeated with a histogram_type of
  CoordActExecTime instead of CoordActLifetime. The execution time
  histogram is expected to be similar but not identical to the lifetime
  histogram. The reason they are different, even when there is no
  queuing, is that execution time does not include initialization time
  or cursor idle time, while lifetime does.
