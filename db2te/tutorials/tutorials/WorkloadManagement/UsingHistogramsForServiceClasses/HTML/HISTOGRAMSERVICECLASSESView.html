The HISTOGRAMSERVICECLASSES view allows you to see the service classes
  for which a histogram was collected. The example below restricts the
  output to that of the CoordActLifetime histogram only. Since aggregate
  activity collection was only turned on for the default user service
  class's default subclass, only that class is shown when selecting from
  the HISTOGRAMSERVICECLASSES view.
