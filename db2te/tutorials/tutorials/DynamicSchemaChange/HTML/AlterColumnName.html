	<b>Scenario: Online changes to the base table</b><BR>
	Later, the company is audited and auditors find two mistakes in the definition
	of the EMPLOYEE table. First, the EMPLOYEE_ID column is misplelled and, second, the type of this 
	column should be SMALLINT instead of INTEGER to save some space.
	
	While this would have previously required dropping all of the objects, and data,
	in the database related to the mistakes, now it's only necessary
	to rename the column and alter the datatype.  This step accomplishes both.  
	It is important to note that the name and data type changes are made online. <BR><BR>
	None of the views that depend on the EMPLOYEE table have to be changed, because the changes do not affect the view definitions and
	views are revalidated automatically.
</p>
<p>
	You should see successful completion messages in the lower right
	as well as a second tab with a result set in it.
