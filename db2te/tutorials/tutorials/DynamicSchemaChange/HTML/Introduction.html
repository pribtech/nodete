  In this tutorial you will see some of the new schema change features available in DB2 9.7.
  These new features significantly improve and simplify the administration of objects
  within a database schema. <BR><BR>
  
  By the end of this tutorial you will be familiar with:
  <ul>
  		<li>how to rename columns in a table</li>
  		<li>how column datatypes can be changed</li>  
  		<li>how views can be created before the underlying tables</li>
  		<li>how database objects can be recreated without the DROP command</li>
  		<li>how database objects are automatically revalidated due to changes to the underlying dependencies</li>
 </ul><BR>
	All of these operations can now be performed online without any outages,
  therefore we call this set of features "Dynamic Schema Change".

	In order to complete this tutorial you need to make sure that the auto-revalidation (AUTO_REVAL) database configuration
	parameter set to DEFERRED_FORCE.  When a new database is created, AUTO_REVAL is 
	default to DEFERRED, that does not allow for creation of objects with errors.  On the other hand, IMMEDIATE
	will automatically try to revalidate all dependent objects.  DEFERRED will
	try to revalidate dependent objects the next time they are accessed.<BR><BR>
	Here is the command for enabling this parameter:<BR>
	<i>db2 update db cfg for &lt;database name&gt; using AUTO_REVAL [IMMEDIATE | DEFERRED | DEFERRED_FORCE]</i><BR>
	This configuration parameter is dynamic, meaning that a change in its value takes effect immediately.  
	You do not need to restart the database.
