<p>
	View the right hand panel.
</p>
<p>
	You can see from the view in the right that the views are successfully created, despite the warnings that
	were issued.  The views have not been validated yet.  This is because	
	we have the AUTO_REVAL database configuration value set to DEFERRED.
	If the AUTO_REVAL database configuration value was set to IMMEDIATE
	then the revalidation would occur as soon as any changes to the view or dependent objects
	are made.

<p>
	You should see a list of two views in the top right panel.
