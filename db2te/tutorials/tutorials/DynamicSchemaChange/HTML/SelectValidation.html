	<b>Scenario: Changes to the Lucky formula</b><BR>
	After some time, the company decides that employees with lower salary should have 
	better chances of winning the "Lucky Employee" award and employees that have a salary higher than $100,000 
	should not be eligible to participate in this contest. 
	The database administrator is given a task of modifying the DB2 objects to reflect the new rules.
</p>
<p>
	The administrator decides to change the LUCKY_NAME function to take each employees salary into consideration, but still selecting a random winner.
	He also decides to change the FULLTIME_EMPLOYEE view to remove the employees with high salary.
	Instead of dropping and recreating the LUCKY_NAME function and FULLTIME_EMPLOYEE view from scratch, 
	the administrator knows to take advantage	of the new CREATE OR REPLACE syntax to do the job.
</p>
<p>
	You should see successful completion messages in the lower right panel.
	As well, there should be a second tab open with a result set.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Summary</b>
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the new dynamic schema change feature, administrators
	have the power to manipulate their tables on the fly without having to worry
	about any views or functions that use those tables.
