<p>Select the three actions on this page in order to illustrate direct read and write activities happening with LOB data.</p>

<p></p>
<h4>Collect direct read and write statistics</h4>
The first step collects direct read and write statistics before inline LOB data is retrieved.

<pre><code>
SELECT DIRECT_READS, DIRECT_WRITES
  FROM SYSIBMADM.SNAPDB
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<h4>Retrieve Inline LOB data</h4>
The second step executes a SQL query to retrieve inline LOB data in the VIEW_TEXT and COLUMN_TEXT columns.

<pre><code>
SELECT VIEW_TEXT, COLUMN_TEXT
  FROM INLINELOBDATA
</code></pre>

<p></p>
<h4>Compare direct read and write statistics</h4>
<p>The third step compares the direct read and write statistics before and after the execution of the query. Please note that there is a 104 direct reads overhead generated by the Technology Explorer. If the same SQL statements run on the DB2 command, you will not see the overhead.</p>
