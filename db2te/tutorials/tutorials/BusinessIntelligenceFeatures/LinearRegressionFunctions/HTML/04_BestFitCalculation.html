<p>The best fit is a value between <em>0</em> and <em>1</em> which tells you how well the equation <em>y = ax + b</em> (with the computed values a and b) fits the actual data supplied. A value of 1 means that we have a perfect fit, while a value of <em>0</em> means that there is no correlation).</p>

<p>When you use the random data, chances are that you will get a very low best fit, normally <em>0</em> or slightly better. Every time you regenerate the random data you will get different best fit values.</p>
