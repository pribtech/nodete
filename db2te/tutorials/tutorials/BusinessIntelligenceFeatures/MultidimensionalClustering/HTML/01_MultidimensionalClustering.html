It provides an elegant method to provide flexible, continuous, and automatic clustering of data along multiple dimensions. This results in significant improvement in the performance of queries, as well as significant reduction in the overhead of data maintenance operations such as reorganization, and index maintenance during <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r.7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000813.html');">SELECT</a>, <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r.7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0001022.html');">UPDATE</a>, and <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r.7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000939.html');">DELETE</a>.</p>

<p>MDC enables a table to be physically clustered on more than one dimension simultaneously (kind of like having multiple clustered indexes). In particular, an MDC table ensures that rows are organized on disk in blocks of consecutive pages, such that all rows within any block have the same dimension values. All blocks contain the same number of pages and multiple blocks can have the same dimension values when there are enough values corresponding to a dimension to warrant this. Dimensions of an MDC table are specified when the table is created. A block index is then automatically created for each dimension, and a composite block index is created for the entire set of dimensions. Dimensions are not restricted to being columns or column sequences. In particular, a dimension can be an expression with arithmetic operators, scalar functions, etc.</p>
