<p>This SQL will refresh the summary table. Since this summary table was created with the <strong>"initially deferred refresh deferred"</strong> clause, no data was placed into the summary table. In essence, only the structure of the summary table was created. The <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000977.html?noframes=true');">REFRESH</a> command will tell DB2 to repopulate this summary table. It will first drop the contents of the table and then create the summary. Since the REFRESH command is not automatic, the command will need to be executed regularly in order the information to be relatively up-to-date. Note that each REFRESH will actually <strong>replace</strong> the contents of the table, NOT add additional rows.</p>
