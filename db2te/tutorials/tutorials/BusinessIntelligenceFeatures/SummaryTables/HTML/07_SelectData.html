<p>Now that you have a general idea about what summary table are good for, let's see how performance increases when we use one.</p>

<p>In this example, we are going to run several SELECT statements against the <em>transactions</em> table that was created in the first step of this tutorial.</p>

<p>We will first run five SELECTS with no optimization involved (using the <em>transactions</em> table by itself); the next five queries will be run on the summary table to retrieve the same sort of information. We will then graph the query times on the same plot to see the difference.</p>
