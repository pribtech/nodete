<p>If any of the following circumstances apply to you and your organization, consider the numerous benefits of table partitioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a data warehouse that would benefit from easier roll-in and roll-out of table data</li>
<li>You have a data warehouse that includes large tables</li>
<li>You are considering a migration to a DB2 V9.1 database from a previous release or a competitive database product</li>
<li>You need to use Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) solutions more effectively</li>
</ul>


<p>Following is a series of SQL statements that will teach you how to partition your tables in different ways</p>

<p>This tutorial covers a small portion of all the options table partitioning allows you to use to give you the flavour of this feature. For a more extensive list of features please refer to the official documentation.</p>
