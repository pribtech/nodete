<p>This example shows the ranking of employees by their bonus. Since there are non-unique bonus values, we get holes in the rank value. The results are ordered by bonus rank. Note that we have multiple rank values which are the same. If you want to have a continuous set of values, you must use the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0023461.html?noframes=true');">DENSERANK</a> function instead of rank. </p>
