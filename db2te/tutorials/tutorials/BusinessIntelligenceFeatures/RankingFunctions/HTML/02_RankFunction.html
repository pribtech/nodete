<p>The ranking function computes the ordinal rank of a row within the partition of the row according to the ordering of the rows in the partition. Rows that are not distinct with respect to the ordering within their partition are assigned the same rank. The results of ranking may be defined with or without gaps in the numbers resulting from duplicate values.

Thus if two or more rows are not distinct with respect to the ordering, there will be one or more gaps in the sequential rank numbering. This example displays the ranking of employees, in order by surname, according to their salary. Note that if the result is required to be ordered by the ranking, replace the ORDER BY clause with: ORDER BY RANK_SALARY or ORDER BY RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) </p>
