<p>You can also have the RANK/DENSERANK value be partitioned over multiple columns. So, the actual breaks occur on more than one column value. In this example, we ask for the RANK function to be applied first to the EDUCATION level and then with BONUS within that. You can also use the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0023461.html?noframes=true');">PARTITION</a> function which allows you to create RANKS within a column, based on column breaks. When you use the PARTITION function, the RANK value is calculated according to breaks within a column. This example ranks employees in a department according to their salary - so instead of an overall ranking of their salary in the company, we find how they rank within a department itself.</p>
