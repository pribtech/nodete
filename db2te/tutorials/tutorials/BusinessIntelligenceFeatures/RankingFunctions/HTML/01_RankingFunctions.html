The ranking function computes the ordinal rank of a row within the partition of the row according to the ordering of the rows in the partition. Rows that are not distinct with respect to the ordering within their partition are assigned the same rank. The results of ranking may be defined with or without gaps in the numbers resulting from duplicate values. If RANK is specified, the rank of a row is defined as 1 plus the number of rows that strictly precede the row. Thus if two or more rows are not distinct with respect to the ordering, there will be one or more gaps in the sequential rank numbering. If DENSERANK is specified, the rank of a row is defined as 1 plus the number of rows preceding the row that are distinct with respect to the ordering. Therefore, there will be no gaps in the sequential rank numbering. The ROWNUMBER function computes the sequential row number, starting with 1 for the first row, of the row within its partition according to the ordering. If the ORDER BY clause is not specified in the window specification, the row numbers are assigned to the rows in arbitrary order as returned by the subselect (not according to any ORDER BY clause in the select-statement).</p>
