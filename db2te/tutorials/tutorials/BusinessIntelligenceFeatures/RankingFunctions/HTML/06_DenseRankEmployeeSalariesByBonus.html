<p>The last example showed how ranking can have "gaps" in the numbers due to ties in the RANK value. You can eliminate these gaps by using the <a onclick="OpenURLInFloatingWindow ('http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0023461.html?noframes=true');">DENSERANK</a> function instead. Here the list of employees is ranked strictly from 1-n with ties (rank values the same) having the same value. The results are ordered by bonus rank. Note that the values are now continuous for the ranking (as opposed to the previous example which had gaps). </p>
