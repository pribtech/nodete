<p>XQuery is case-sensitive. This is very different from SQL where all commands and text are folded to uppercase unless the values are placed in quotes. The following examples show how variables in XQuery are diffrent. <em>$A</em> and <em>$a</em> are two different values. Try the query and then correcting the error by changing the upper case <em>$A</em> to lower case <em>$a</em>.</p>
