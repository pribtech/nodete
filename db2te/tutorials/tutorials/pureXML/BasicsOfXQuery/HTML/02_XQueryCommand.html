<p>XQuery commands always start with the XQUERY keyword. This keyword can be in either upper or lower case. XQUERY command can be issued from a DB2 command line (CLP) or be part of a script. In any case, DB2 optimizer will recognize that the command following the XQuery keyword will need to be parsed as a XQuery command.</p>
