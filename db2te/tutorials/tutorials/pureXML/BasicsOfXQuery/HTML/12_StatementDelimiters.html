<p>XQuery uses a large number of special characters, including semicolons as a statement delimiter. Since this is also the SQL delimiter, one needs to be careful when combining XQuery and SQL. One of the few characters that doesn't appear to cause problems between both languages is the hash (#) symbol). Notice that there are two statement result in two different tabs opened, one for each statement that ran.</p>
