<p>Note that the comparison operators work differently on sets. In order for two sets to be equal, they don't need to be of equal length. Two sets are equal if <em>at least one value for first set should be equal to at least one value of the second set</em>. That means that (0,1) equals to (1,2). The same holds for other basic comparison operators applied on sets.</p>
