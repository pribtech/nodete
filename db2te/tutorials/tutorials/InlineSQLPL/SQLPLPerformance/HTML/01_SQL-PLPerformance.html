<p>There are a number of places where you can use SQL PL. If you followed tutorials in sequence, you should already know about triggers and functions. But how do you choose which way is better? There is no quick answer, it all depends on performance or flexibility you want. In this tutorial we will compare performance of  SQL PL code that perform the same task but is located in different places:</p>

<ol>
    <li>SQL PL function</li>
    <li>SQL PL trigger with no external functions used,</li>
    <li>SQL PL trigger with an external SQL PL function used,</li>
    <li>SQL PL stored procedure with no external functions used</li>
    <li>SQL PL stored procedure with an external SQL PL function</li>
</ol>

<p>The main difference between 1-3 and 4-5 is where the logic gets executed. SQL PL functions and triggers are executed inside the DB2 engine, while the SQL PL stored procedures are "fenced" outside he database. There may be more overhead in interpreting the SQL PL for the internal procedures, but this might outweigh the cost of procedure switching.</p>
