<p>In this step we will use five different ways (mentioned in step 1) to calculate tax amounts based on the individual's salary. You can then build a graph to compare which of the methods got the best time (i.e. each statement is run for 10 seconds and <em>best</em> time is graphed). You would probably want to run the statement a couple of times - remember, these statements are fairly simple. In a real world you won't rely on this sample statistics completely, you would want to implement solutions and compare their performance against a real database.</p>
