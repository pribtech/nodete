<p>This example takes a transaction table and uses it to update a product table with some new values.</p>

<p>We are going to start by creating two tables. We will then add several invoice records to the first table called <em>invoice</em>. Every invoice has invoice id, date of sale, number of items solved and total price for all the items. The second, <em>transaction</em> table contains a list of transactions.</p>
