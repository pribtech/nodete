	This tutorial demonstrates the advantages of using a Created Global 
	Temporary Table (CGTT) over a Declared Global Temporary Table (DGTT) or a regular table.
	Unlike DGTTs, the definitions of CGTTs are persistent over multiple sessions and
	can be shared between connections. Application objects such as Stored Procedures 
	and User Defined Functions are supported by CGTTs.
</p>
<p>This tutorial uses a tax computation process to compare the following differences
	between CGTTs, DGTTs and regular tables:
	<ul>
		<li>Application Object Supports</li>
		<li>Data Isolation</li>
		<li>Automatic Cleanup</li>
		<li>Query Performance</li>
	</ul>

<p><b>Scenario Overview</b></p>  
<p>
	At the end of a financial year, the payroll department computes 
	income tax owed for each the employees. The tutorial demonstrates the use of 
	all three types of tables to store intermediate results during the tax 
	calculation process.
</p>
<p>
	Each employee gets tax exemption for salary up to 100 000.  
	The proof for exemption is submitted at the end of the financial 
	year. At the beginning of the financial year, the tax payable by an employee 
	is calculated based on the employees income. 
	At the end of the year, once all the employees within a department 
	have submitted their tax proofs, the tax calculation process is triggered. 
	The tax process updates the payroll table with
	the total tax and the balance payable. 
</p>
<p>
	All the intermediate results of tax calculation are updated in the TAX_CAL table. 
	After the tax calculation is complete	another procedure updates the payroll table 
	with the tax data. 	A function generates the Income Tax sheet for all the employees.
