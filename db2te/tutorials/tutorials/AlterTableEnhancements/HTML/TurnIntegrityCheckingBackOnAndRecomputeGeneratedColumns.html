<p>
	Run the statement in the right panel.
</p>
<p>
	As mentioned in the previous step, the unchecked option in the set integrity statement
	allowed previously entered data to be unchanged.  By using the checked option,
	DB2 replaces those old values with values generated from the new definition for the column.
</p>
<p>
	The statements in the editor change the table defintion again, but this time
	when integrity checking is turned back on, the integrity will be checked, so all old values
	are recalculated.
</p>
<p>
	You should see a result set after running the queries that shows the newly calculated
	values.
