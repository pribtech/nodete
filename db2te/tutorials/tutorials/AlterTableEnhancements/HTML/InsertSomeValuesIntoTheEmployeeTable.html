<p>
	Run the SQL in the right panel.
</p>
<p>
	The SQL will insert values into the salary table and then display the table contents.
</p>
<p>
	A couple of points to note are that the columns used to generate the last column can not be left blank.
	This is specified in the table definition by making the column "not null".  Also, The insert statement
	only inserts values into three of the four columns.  This is because the forth is generated and will actually
	throw and error if you try to insert anything into it.  Go ahead, try it.
</p>
<p>
	Once you've run the script, you should see a result set with generated values for the right most column.
